      "['Johannesburg: India’s win over South Africa in the third and final Test on Saturday helped Virat Kohli and company to retain the ICC Test Championship mace.The 63-run win at the Wanderers ensured that South Africa cannot move ahead of India in the ICC Test Team Rankings at April 3, 2018, cut-off date, even if they go on to win all four Tests against Australia in March 2018.India had arrived in South Africa on 124 points, with South Africa 13 points behind on 111 points. However, Kohli’s men will return on 121 points as opposed to South Africa’s 115 points, which will be good enough for them to keep possession of the prestigious ICC Test Championship mace for the second year in succession at the April cut-off.Kohli will be presented with the mace, which is a symbol of excellence and a recognition of a side’s outstanding performance in the purest format of the game, and a cheque of USD 1million in a presentation ceremony.Proud prouder proudest. Hats off to the whole team for showing character throughout. This day will always be special. Jai hind pic.twitter.com/z2T0er5fLd— Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) January 27, 2018Had South Africa pulled off a 3-0 series win against India, then a win by 2-0 or better against Australia would have helped them reclaim the mace that they had last won in 2015.Now, South Africa will have to win at least one Test against Australia to retain second place in the Test table, which, in turn, will earn them USD 500,000.In this scenario, Australia will pocket USD 200,000 for a third-place finish. However, if Australia win by 3-0 or 4-0, then they will leapfrog South Africa into second place.The winner of the two-Test New Zealand vs England series, which will also be played in March 2018, will decide the side that finishes fourth on the table and will take home USD 100,000.A drawn series will mean New Zealand will finish ahead of England.The cut-off for this year has been adjusted to April 3, 2018, which is the final day of the four-Test series between South Africa and Australia in Johannesburg, as well as last day of the two-Test series between New Zealand and England in Christchurch.

The district administration has been able to control the situation so far, but additional forces will be called to ensure that the situation does not worsen,” he said.Meanwhile, slamming the law and order situation in UP, former chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav today termed the violence in Kasganj as unfortunate.”This, happening on Republic Day is unfortunate. People of Kasganj respect each other. We want action against culprits but no injustice should be done,” Akhilesh Yadav said.A short video clip of Friday’s bike rally also surfaced on the social media showing hundreds of young men, many of them holding the tricolour and saffron flag, getting ready for the bike rally.The video shows them standing on one of the streets of the Kasganj town, probably the time when they were told by the members of another community to take a different route for their rally.', 'Ahmedabad: With an increasing number of youngsters taking to social media to find new friends and life partners, the Gujarat High Court on Friday observed that marriages fixed on social networking sites like  Facebook are “bound to fail”.The high court made this unusual observation while disposing off a case of domestic violence filed by a woman against her husband.The court advised the couple to dissolve their troubled marriage claiming that a wedlock fixed on Facebook is “bound to fail”. Justice JB Pardiwala made the observation in his January 24 order while hearing the case filed by a Rajjot woman, Fansi Shah, who had accused her husband Jaideep Shah and her in-laws of harassing her for dowry.“They got married and within two months thereafter problems cropped up in their marital life. I should make note of one fact that the parties did try to settle the matter, however, the settlement could not be arrived at,” the judge observed.“This is one of those modern marriages fixed on Facebook, therefore, bound to fail,” Pardiwala said.Jaideep, who hails from Navsari, met Fansi on Facebook in 2011, when he was pursuing a degree course in engineering. The two frequently started chatting on Facebook and came close to each other.In the year 2015, the two tied the knot with the consent of their parents. However, the marital relationship turned sour within two months.The relationship between the two soured so much that Fansi actually lodged an FIR against Jaideep, his brother Piyush and parents-in-law Vikeshbhai and Anitaben, accusing them of domestic violence and harassing her for dowry.Responding to it, Jaideep and his family members approached the high court in 2016 seeking quashing of the case.The couple, who are still in their early 20s, were advised by the high court to consider divorce and move ahead in life.“I am still of the view that the parties should explore the possibility of settlement and put an end to the marriage with consent. Both the sides are young. Once the marriage is dissolved, they can think about their future avenues in life,” he said.Noting that the allegations were mainly against the husband, Pardiwala quashed the charges against the in-laws.The court, however, no gave no relief to Jaideep and ordered that an investigation against him shall proceed in accordance with the law. ', 'NEW DELHI: All 10 ASEAN leaders conveyed to India their desire for it to play a more assertive role in the strategically important Indo-Pacific region while recognising the country’s growing stature in ensuring regional peace and stability.“Yes,” said Secretary East in the Ministry of External Affairs Preeti Saran when asked during a media briefing whether the leaders of the powerful ASEAN grouping favoured a more assertive role for India in the Indo-Pacific region where China has been ramping up its military presence.On whether ASEAN wants India to play a more pro-active role in the Indo-Pacific in the wake of China’s growing expansionism in the area, Saran said India-ASEAN relationship stands on its own.\\n“All the leaders conveyed their desire for a greater participation of India (in the Indo-Pacific region),” she said.The desire by the ASEAN countries for a greater role by India in the Indo-Pacific region assumes significance in the wake of rising tensions between China and a number of countries of the grouping over the South China Sea dispute.Leaders of all 10 ASEAN member countries were here to participate at a summit meeting to mark 25 years of India- ASEAN ties and to attend India’s Republic Day celebrations.Indo-Pacific broadly refers to the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions, which also include the disputed South China Sea where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei question China’s claims over almost the entire waterway.The US has also been pitching for greater Indo-US cooperation in the strategically key Indo-Pacific region.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) comprises Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Laos and Brunei.Saran said all the ASEAN leaders appreciated India’s positive role in the Indo-Pacific region.A number of pressing issues including the situation in the Indo-Pacific region and ways to tackle threat of terrorism figured during the summit meeting as well as in bilateral talks Prime Minister Narendra Modi had with the ASEAN leaders.Referring to the challenge of terrorism, Saran said that ASEAN leaders emphasised on the need for concerted global efforts to contain the menace.“Terrorism does not know any boundaries. You know what is cross border terrorism, you cannot be selective in tackling terrorism…. They (ASEAN leaders) recognised the need for the menace to be fought collectively,” said Saran.She said India will host a conference on ways to counter radicalisation.Referring to the deliberations at the Plenary session at the summit, Saran said Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered India’s digital expertise and expressed readiness to set up digital villages in some of the countries as part of a pilot project.He also said that India will host an ASEAN-India start up festival this year.She said next year will be celebrated as the year of India-ASEAN tourism by both the sides.India also offered 1,000 scholarships in IIT for PhD students from ASEAN countries.Saran and several other officials of the MEA also talked about the meticulous planning that went into hosting the ASEAN leaders including choosing fabric for pillow covers and arranging for various recepies considering the food habits of the leaders.They also talked about how External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was involved in minute details for successful hosting of leaders.', \"He wanted to mark India’s 69th Republic Day celebrations with calls for an Azad Kashmir. Lord Nazir and his small group of people outside Indian High Commission in London though may not have expected to face a wave of Indians out to silence his unfounded claims and obnoxious demand.Born in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Lord Nazir – a member of British House of Lords, attempted to mount a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London on Friday. He and his supporters called it ‘Black Day’ campaign and came armed with placards and hoardings which accused India of ‘illegally occupying’ Jammu and Kashmir. The group however was countered by an even bigger group consisting of people of Indian origin. Calls of Bharat Mata ki Jai and Vande Mataram reverberated, and placards underlining India’s commitment towards peace were seen all over. According to news agency ANI, the counter-protestors questioned intentions of Lord Nazir and accused him of making a mockery of the British system by blatantly posturing Pakistan’s vested interests.#WATCH Clashes erupted outside Indian High Commission in London as British Lord Nazir called for Azad Kashmir on India's Republic Day pic.twitter.com/IJQb3XajIu— ANI (@ANI) January 26, 2018A controversial figure, the 60-year-old Lord Nazir has been in the centre of several scandals. He had once reportedly said that he can offer a bounty on Barack Obama if the US offers a bounty on terrorist Hafiz Saeed. He also once claimed that an attempt on Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai’s life was carried out by agents close to Pakistani establishment, to discredit Taliban.. He would later admit he had no proof to back his statement with.Lord Nazir’s Friday protests too, once again, appeared to be based on a complete lack of facts and proof. As his campaign was met with stiff resistance, temperatures soared and local police authorities were called in to contain the two groups once sloganeering gave way to scuffles.\", 'Maruti Suzuki has dropped another teaser of its showstopper for the Auto Expo 2018, the ‘Concept Future S’, and it reveals what the face of this new compact SUV concept will be like.Designed completely in-house, Maruti says that the Future S will preview an all-new design language for the compact car segment. The company also states that, with its compact SUV concept, it has achieved the next level of “design evolution” in terms of proportions, body sculpting and fusing bold patterns and colours.While it will make its debut at the Auto Expo 2018 in concept form, the production version of the Future S will slot in below the massively popular Vitara Brezza as Maruti wants to enjoy the same success in a lower segment.The Future S will be over 200mm shorter than the Vitara Brezza, and getting the design right will be a challenge for Maruti Suzuki. But it has a high bonnet line, near-vertical A-pillars and design cues that make it a more of a traditional SUV than a crossover. It’s a formula that has worked well for the Vitara Brezza, and should appeal to the wide customer base Maruti has in mind for the concept’s production version.The production version of the Future S will be built on Suzuki’s lightweight ‘Heartect’ platform, while engine options are likely to include the trusty K-series 1.2-litre petrol with some form of electrification, and a future 1.5-litre diesel, developed in-house, could enter showrooms later this year or in early 2019.Also on display will be the e-Survivor electric SUV concept, a working model of the next-generation Suzuki Hybrid system and, of course, the all-new Swift.', 'Seoul: Scientists have developed a smart baby pillow that can prevent and even correct mild cases of flat head syndrome, caused when infants repeatedly lie on their backs to sleep.Babies are born with highly malleable skulls, and therefore receiving constant pressure on a particular part of their head may lead to some positional flattening or molding of the head.Although this does not harm brain development nor cause any lasting appearance problems, simple practices, like placing them in different positions over the course of each day, can easily prevent a baby from developing an asymmetrical skull shape.“We came up with the idea to help new parents who are in drastic need of sleep. We wanted to help them relax and rest at least when their babies are asleep,” said scientists from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in South Korea, who developed the device.The smart baby pillow is designed to help induce the correct sleeping posture, thereby preventing babies from developing flat head syndrome.It features an embedded air volume control system, as well as the image-based soft tactile sensor.“A soft tactile sensor has been applied to monitor the position of a newborn’s head in real time,” said Tae Hun Chung from UNIST.“We have also added a system that automatically controls the volume of air in the pillow for a perfectly symmetrical skull. This saves the trouble of attempting to change a newborn’s head in different positions every 1 to 2 hours,” said Chung.The team plans to commercialize the product and later expand into the medical device market.“The device itself would certainly be a great help for those stressed-out parents,” said HyeWon Cho from UNIST.“By allowing mothers to have some relaxation time, it can also help prevent or treat symtoms of postnatal depression and anxiety,” Cho said.', 'Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus Padmaavat is based on Malik Muhammad Jayasi’s epic poem Padmavat. So, a disclaimer right at the start of the film rests the case, putting all the allegations and accusations to the burner. Most of Bhansali films take into a larger-than-life world where his characters rule the screen space. The grandeur of his sets is a small indicator of the filmmaker’s vision. His canvas is huge and he expects his audience to witness this visual treat with a likewise mindset. Coming to his Padmaavat, well, the basic story is known to all by now. History repeats itself but this time to leave the viewers speechless. The Rajputana pride is brilliantly acted by Shahid Kapoor, who plays Maharawal Ratan Singh. His dialogues beautifully articulate the valour of being a Mewadi Rajput. He falls in love with a gorgeous Singhali princess named Padmavati, here essayed by Deepika Padukone. She portrays an equally brave and courageous Kshatriyani who prefers to envelop herself in the fire than succumb to a ruthless Khilji. Their happiness is short-lived as Rajputana Maha Guru named Raghav Chetan is punished for watching the royal couple while they were sharing an intimate moment. Rani Padmavati urges the Ratan Singh to send the Maha Guru away from their mitti (motherland) and that would be his biggest moment. However, as fate would have it, the Maha Guru finds his way into the Khilji regime. Ranveer Singh has given his best shot as a barbaric ruler Alauddin Khilji. He is so brutal that he kills his own uncle (Raza Murad) for power. Khilji falls for Padmavati and his urge to meet her weaves an entire epic together. Jim Sarbh’s act as Malik Gafur, who is Khilji’s slave is impressive. The background score is worth remembering. The costumes and cinematography applause-worthy. But the only issue is the problem of continuity and abrupt cuts in editing. Khilji perhaps is one character who will not leave you even after the film gets over. He is brutal and will remind you of Khal Drogo from ‘Game Of Thrones’. Deepika as Rani Padmavati echoes the high sentiment of a Rajput woman. The climax is most dramatic with jaw-dropping imagery clouding your mind. The fight sequence between Khilji and Ratan Singh is a takeaway. Also, Padmavati’s bravery is defined in the last scene which will rip your soul and make you go back in time to salute the pride and righteousness of the Rajput princess. P.S: Book your tickets now, contrary to rumours, there is no objectionable content in the film.

At the 2014 Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold, Saina defeated Sindhu, who returned the favour at the India Open Super Series last year.London Games bronze-medallist, Saina had, however, upstaged Sindhu to clinch the women’s singles title in the Senior National Badminton Championship last year.The celebrated duo was scheduled to meet in the Premier Badminton League opener between Awadhe Warriors and Chennai Smashers but Saina pulled out due to an ankle injury.In the domestic league, Saina and Sindhu faced each other twice. While Saina, playing for Hyderabad HotShots then, had defeated Sindhu (Awadhe Warriors) in the 2013 Indian Badminton League, Sindhu beat Saina in the PBL 2 semifinal in January, 2017.Today, Saina hardly broke a sweat in the opening game as she didn’t allow the Chinese to come near her after grabbing an 8-3 lead early on.In the second game, Saina once again moved to an 11-3 lead but this time Chen narrowed it down to 17-19 before the Indian closed out the match.Olympic silver-medallist Sindhu, on the other hand, gave a lesson in badminton to Goh in a lopsided contest.

Police begin investigation,the businessman is absconding— ANI (@ANI) January 29, 2018\\nIn her complaint, the actress said that Khanna molested her over the past few months and misbehaved with her. A case has been registered under Sections 304 D (stalking) and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code, according to the Mumbai Police.After the initial investigation, the police said that the two had known each other for a while, however, the relationship between them soured over some issues following which the actress stopped talking to the businessman.Nevertheless, the businessman allegedly kept calling and following her.After failing to convince Khanna to stop stalking, the veteran actress finally approached the police and filed a complaint at Juhu Police Station.Amar Khanna is said to be absconding at the moment.Aman, a popular actress of her time, had shot to fame with films like ‘Hare Rama, Hare Krishna’, ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’, ‘Heera Panna’, ‘Yaadon Ki Baraat’, ‘Don’ and many others.  Zeenat Aman was earlier married to actor Mazhar Khan who passed away in 1998 due to serious health issues.The Bollywood diva, who revolutionised the concept of fashion at a time when it was considered a not-so-important factor in Bollywood films, had once said that female actors in those days were not handsomely paid as they are today.Before Bollywood, Zeenat entered the Miss India contest and was the third runner-up.

', 'New Delhi: During the presentation of the Economic Survey 2017-18, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian had pointed out that this year’s document is in pink colour.The reason for this, as he stated, was to extend the committee’s support to the growing worldwide movement to end violence against women.Subramanian, while addressing a press conference here, shed light on the need for gender-specific measures highlighted in the survey, particularly in the agriculture sector, due to ‘feminisation’ of this segment.“Women play a significant and crucial role in agricultural development and allied fields. This is a fact long taken for granted. There is feminisation of agriculture sector because of growing migration of men from rural to urban areas. Gender-specific interventions are therefore required to support them,” the survey read.Taking into account the inherent gender equality, assessments were made based on three specific dimensions of gender — Agency (relates to women’s ability to make decisions on reproduction, spending on themselves, spending on their households and their own mobility and health), Attitudes (relate to attitudes about violence against women/wives, and the ideal number of daughters preferred relative to the ideal number of sons) and Outcomes (relate to ‘son preference’ measured by sex ratio of last child, female employment, choice of contraception, education level, age at marriage, age at first birth and physical or sexual violence experienced by women).According to the survey, over the last 10-15 years, India’s performance improved on 14 out of 17 indicators of women’s agency, attitudes, and outcomes. On seven of them, the improvement has been such that India’s situation is comparable to that of a cohort of countries after accounting for levels of development.The survey also noted that gender outcomes exhibit a convergence pattern, improving with wealth to a greater extent in India than in similar countries so that even where it is lagging, it can expect to catch up over time. It, however, cautioned that on several other indicators, notably employment, use of reversible contraception, and son preference, India has some distance to traverse because development has not proved to be an antidote.Hailing the Northeastern states as a model for the rest of the country, the survey noted that it is consistently out-performing others and not because they are richer; hinterland states are lagging behind but the surprise is that some southern states do less well than their development levels would suggest.In a bid to reduce the existing gender gap, the survey recommended that India must confront the societal preference, even meta-preference for a son, which appears inoculated to development. The skewed sex ratio in favour of males led to the identification of “missing” women. But there may be a meta-preference manifesting itself in fertility stopping rules contingent on the sex of the last child, which notionally creates “unwanted” girls, estimated at about 21 million, adds the Survey. Consigning these odious categories to history soon should be society’s objective, the survey opined.The survey also acknowledged the government’s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Sukanya Samridhi Yojana schemes, and mandatory maternity leave rules, adding that they were all steps in the right direction.“Just as India has committed to moving up the ranks in Ease of Doing Business indicators, a similar commitment should have endeavored on the gender front,” the survey suggested. ', 'India-Pakistan cricket games at all levels garner attention. No long ago, Virat Kohli’s men had failed terribly against Pakistan to hand them the ICC Champions Trophy in England. They haven’t had any opportunity to settle the score since, but India’s Under-19 stars can salve some of the country’s wounded pride when they take on Pakistan’s Under-19s in the semi-finals of the World Cup in New Zealand on Tuesday.The tendency to keep thinking about “revenge”can often bring disastrous results. Luckily for the Indian Under-19 team, they have coach Rahul “Composure” Dravid to ensure that the revenge talk doesn’t completely blow them over. While the entire country is working itself up over the prospect of the encounter against the arch-rivals, Dravid is keeping his wits about him. “Our preparation and our planning doesn’t change at all. We don’t approach this game any differently from how we would any other game, we still approach it to play good cricket, try and execute our skills and hopefully the result will fall our way. But from an experience perspective, I’m excited about it, the fact that, irrespective of the results, we get our Under 19 boys to understand what it’s like to play an India-Pakistan game. At this level, all it is about is about experiences,” Dravid told icc-cricket.com ahead of the showdown at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.“We talk about this level and Under 19 cricket being about learning and experiences and experiencing different things, whether it’s conditions, whether it’s playing in an ICC tournament.“It’s great that we’ve been able to, in a way, set up to have an India-Pakistan game as well. There is a different buzz about it in the sense that we know that the game is followed probably a little bit more closely than some of the other games we have.“For the last couple of years, we haven’t played Pakistan at this level, so it’s really nice for our boys to have that experience of actually playing against Pakistan.”Shedding light on what he himself went through in his cricketing days ahead of games against Pakistan, Dravid said: “Every game was important, but it’s just that you knew it was one of the most followed games in the world.“For people it meant a lot more. As players, it doesn’t really change things, it doesn’t change how you practice and prepare. From my perspective, I really enjoyed playing Pakistan, they had a really good team in my time and had some great cricketers.“It was always a privilege to play against them. We got on quite well with a lot of the Pakistani boys. It was always great to play them, we won sometimes, we lost sometimes, but we always came away with great experiences.”India’s Under-19s are in complete control in the ongoing tournament, having convincingly beaten Australia, Papua New Guinea, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh on their way into the last 4. However, the challenge they face this time in Pakistan is definitely of a much superior level. Dravid is completely aware of what his charges are up against.“They bowled very well in this tournament, there strength is their bowling and they’ve shown that. We’ve batted well in this tournament so it’s going to be a good contest and we’re looking forward to it, looking forward to competing against a good bowling attack.“I thought the Bangladeshi attack was really disciplined, Australia had a couple of decent quicks, so we’ve played some good bowlers in this tournament. But we do recognise that this Pakistani bowling attack is a good one, we respect that, and hopefully we’ll be well prepared and we’ll execute our skills well tomorrow,” he said.The match starts 3 am IST and the winner of the match will go on to play Australia in the final on February 3 at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui.

Just finishing what it has started already would be a very ambitious and fantastic agenda to complete.”We think of the twin balance sheet challenges having 4 ‘R’s – Recognition, Resolution, Recapitalisation and Reforms. I think now we are well ahead on all of them Subramanian said.“From the very 1st survey onwards we have spoken about the twin balance sheet challenges, under capitalised banks which held back growth for a very long time. This year a series of very important steps are being taken,” he added.“Major achievements this year gone are the launch of Goods and Services Tax, decisive tackling of Twin Balance Sheet challenge and validation of achievements and recognition of medium term prospects, the CEA said.Subramanian said that this year oil prices went up that affected consumption and government finances and also held back real economic activity.The Economic Survey today said the average retail inflation has declined to a six-year low of 3.3 percent in 2017-18, with the economy moving towards a more stable price regime.The document further said the GDP growth has averaged 7.3 percent for the period from 2014-15 to 2017-18, which is the highest among the major economies of the world.India is expected to regain the world’s fastest growing major economy tag as it is likely to clock 7-7.5 percent growth rate in 2018-19, up from 6.75 percent in the current fiscal, the Economic Survey said.', 'New Delhi: The Economic Survey today said the average retail inflation has declined to a six-year low of 3.3 percent in 2017-18, with the economy moving towards a more stable price regime.The survey for 2017-18 was tabled by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Parliament today. He is scheduled to present the last full budget of the current Narendra Modi-led NDA government on February 1.“Controlling inflation has been a priority area for the central government,” the survey said, adding that inflation in the country continued to moderate during 2017-18.Consumer Price Index (CPI) based headline inflation, factored in by the Reserve Bank of India while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy, averaged 3.3 percent during the period which “is the lowest” in the last six financial years.The decline in inflation was broad-based across major commodity groups except for housing and fuel and light.The survey noted that the economy has “witnessed a gradual transition” from a period of high and variable inflation to more stable prices in the last four years. Headline inflation measured by the CPI has remained under control for the fourth successive year, it said.“In fact, the decline in inflation in the first half of the current fiscal year was indicative of a benign food inflation which ranged between (-) 2.1 to 1.5 percent,” the survey said. This has been possible due to good agricultural production coupled with regular price monitoring by the government, it added.As per the survey, the rise in food inflation in recent months is mainly due to factors driving prices of vegetables and fruits.“If we a look at state-wise inflation during 2017-18, many states have witnessed a sharp fall in CPI inflation. Inflation in 17 states was below 4 percent during the period.“This has been possible due to various efforts made to contain inflation at various level by the government,” it said.The document further said the GDP growth has averaged 7.3 percent for the period from 2014-15 to 2017-18, which is the highest among the major economies of the world.“That this growth has been achieved in a milieu of lower inflation, improved current account balance and a notable reduction in the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio makes it all the more credible,” said the survey report authored by a team led by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian.

', 'David Beckham`s dream of launching a Major League Soccer franchise in Miami is set to become a reality Monday, with the global superstar finally unveiling plans for the team after a tumultuous four-year quest.MLS announced Friday it was preparing to “make a major announcement regarding the future of soccer in Miami”, inviting members of the public to what is expected to be the announcement of a 25th league club.Hundreds of free tickets to the event were snapped up within hours of being made available, MLS said on Sunday.The team is expected to begin MLS play in 2020 at a 25,000-seat stadium to be built in Miami`s Overtown neighborhood.Just over 11 years after announcing he would leave Real Madrid for the MLS Los Angeles Galaxy in a deal that included the chance to purchase an expansion team at a reduced rate, Beckham will make good on plans he first announced in February 2014.Several failed stadium sites delayed his consortium`s efforts, other MLS teams making their debuts while Beckham struggled to get his off the ground, unable to find an agreeable place for a specially built venue.The group edged closer to success last year after securing a land deal for a proposed stadium project. Earlier plans for a waterfront site and others near the Miami Marlins baseball stadium and NBA Miami Heat arena fell through.MLS Commissioner Don Garber said last month the Miami franchise project was “the most complicated situation in any market that we`ve experienced” because of the Miami area political structure and fast-changing real estate environment.Launch of the new Beckham-backed team will mark the second attempt to start a Miami-based MLS franchise.The Miami Fusion, which made their debut in the 1998 MLS season, played for four seasons before being cut from the league after the 2001 campaign amid low ticket sales and the lowest revenues of any team in the competition.Beckham, 42, retired in 2013 after a 20-year career that saw him win league crowns with Manchester United in England, Real Madrid in Spain, the Galaxy in North America and Paris Saint-Germain in his farewell matches.He also played for England from 1996 to 2009, winning 115 caps.His five-year stint in MLS with the Galaxy boosted football`s profile in North America and contributed to the steady growth in attendances across the MLS.When Beckham arrived in 2007, average attendances through the league were 16,770; when he ended his five-year stint they had increased to 18,807 per game. By 2017, that number had increased to 22,113.Announcing plans for his Miami team four years ago, Beckham said he had already identified players who he hoped to lure to Florida.“It would be disrespectful for me to say what players I want in the team.

The Highly Skilled Migrants group claims to represent over 600 doctors, engineers, IT professionals, teachers and their families in Britain and has raised over 25,000 pounds to challenge the UK Home Office in the courts where necessary.“We are a group of highly skilled migrants who have been suffering because of injustice done by the Home Office. This group was formed coincidently on different social media platforms because of the unfairness and inhumane policies the Home Office had been bringing,” the group said in a statement.The protest on Tuesday focussed on the issue of indefinite leave to remain (ILR) applications being delayed or turned down by the UK Home Office on the basis of a section of the UK Immigration Act which is aimed at criminals and tax evaders.The professionals, who entered the UK on a Tier 1 (General) visa years ago, are entitled to apply for ILR after five years of lawful residency in the UK.While the visa category used by numerous IT professionals from India among others was discontinued in 2010, the applicants are eligible to apply for permanent residency in Britain if they meet the necessary requirements.“Skilled migrants with excellent educational and professional skills are being refused ILR on the ground of ‘tax error rectification’ because of small errors they have made in their tax returns in the past, which they have long ago rectified and paid off,” claims Aditi Bhardwaj, one of the organisers of the protest.Most protesting professionals, who are from countries outside the European Union (EU), claim to no longer have any ties to their country of origin as they have made their lives in the UK over the past many years. They are also protesting against the long delays in processing of these ILR or permanent residency documents.The UK Home Office claims it resolves all visa applications “as quickly as possible”.“It is vital, however, that the correct decisions are made, particularly with complex Tier-1 applications that require detailed consideration and verification of evidence with HMRC.

The report, however, excludes government funds from its figures.Others in the list include United Kingdom (4th, USD 9,919 billion), Germany (5th, USD 9,660 billion), France (7th, USD 6,649 billion), Canada (8th, USD 6,393 billion), Australia (9th, USD 6,142 billion) and Italy (10th, USD 4,276 billion).The report further noted that India was the best performing wealth market globally in 2017 as its total wealth swelled from USD 6,584 billion in 2016 to USD 8,230 billion in 2017, registering a 25 per cent growth.Meanwhile, during the period under consideration China’s wealth saw an increase of 22 per cent and global wealth rose by 12 per cent (from USD 192 trillion at the end of 2016 to USD 215 trillion at the end of 2017).Over the past decade (2007-2017) India’s total wealth increased from USD 3,165 billion in 2007 to USD 8,230 billion in 2017, a jump of 160 per cent.The report further noted that India, is home to 3,30,400 HNWIs (individuals with USD 1 million or more in net assets). Globally, India was ranked 9th in this aspect while US topped the list with 50,47,400 HNWIs (high-net-worth individuals).India is also home to 20,730 multi-millionaires, 7th largest in the world. And in terms of resident billionaires, India with 119 such individuals was named among the top three countries globally, after the US and China.A billionaire is defined as an individual with USD 1 billion or more in net assets.“In general, it was a good year for all W10 (wealthiest 10) markets, thanks to strong global stock market gains – the MSCI world index was up 23 per cent and the Dow Jones (DJIA) was up 26 per cent during the year (in USD terms),” the report said, adding “wealth held in China, India, USA, Japan and Australia all grew strongly over the past year”.', 'What is it?\\nA milestone vehicle of sorts for Volvo, as with it, Volvo now has an SUV for every series of car they make. This is an important step as SUVs are all the rage right now. Volvo’s baby SUV is set to arrive here around mid-2018, and when it does, it will square off against three German rivals, BMW’s X1, Mercedes’ GLA and Audi’s Q3; its other competitor, the Jaguar E-Pace is yet to arrive here.The XC40 is also a milestone for the Swedish carmaker as it’s the first Volvo built on the company’s new compact modular architecture (CMA) platform, co-developed with owners Geely. This platform will also underpin the future ’40 series’ cars as well as vehicles from Lynk & Co – Geely’s new automotive brand positioned between itself and Volvo. CMA is also designed to support hybrids and fully electrified vehicles, and of course being a Volvo, the XC40 and cars on this platform will also benefit from a raft of safety and driver assistance like the Blind Spot Information and Cross Traffic Alert system offered on its larger siblings.What’s it like on the outside?\\nThe XC40’s style is refreshingly unique. It’s still a Volvo, thanks to signature design elements like the Thor’s Hammer headlights, the boomerang-like tail-light arrangement and the seatbelt motif on the grille, but British designer Ian Kettle said he wanted the XC40 to look like a tough little robot and has chiseled a chunky and edgy style. It looks simply brilliant, and the straight lines and squared-off design lend a more youthful and funky style, setting the XC40 apart from its larger stable mates. In an era where many luxury SUVs and cars look like different-sized interpretations of each other, this, to me, is a welcome move.The nose is dominated by a large rectangular grille and the headlight signature elements. The side has a sharply upswept window line at the D-pillar that neatly leads into the base of the rear spoiler. A cool little detail is the Swedish flag rubber tab nestled under the bonnet.The SUV rides quite high and there’s a choice of stylish rims sizes ranging from 17 to 21 inches; expect India to get the 18- inchers. The design should go down well in our market where buyers prefer large wheels, a high ground clearance and that traditional upright SUV stance.What’s it like on the inside?\\nThe insides are stylish too and the details lavished on every little component are like works of art. It’s so welcome on a car in this segment, quite unlike what you’d typically find in its competitors, and more in tune with the style-abundant interiors of a Mini. Bits like the swoopy door handles, frameless inner rear-view mirror, the Orrefors crystal gear lever, the retro AC vents and even the adjustment knobs are meticulously and beautifully styled. The steering wheel boss is squarish, which looks pretty neat along with the squared central dash area housing the touchscreen and air vents. All of this is well built and practical too. The vents can be individually shut and you’ll find yourself looking for reasons to use the knob simply for the quality and satisfying ‘click’ it operates with; it’s almost therapeutic, like popping bubble wrap. What’s commendable is that even on its smallest SUV, the portrait-oriented touchscreen is the same large 9.0-inch Sensus unit found on Volvo’s flagship SUV, the XC90. It’s crisp and clear and also has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The vertical screen may not look right to some, but it has its advantages; it feels more natural scrolling vertically than swiping, and in navigation mode, you get to see more of the road ahead.Passenger space is adequate, and while we didn’t get a chance to seat five, it’s obvious that the XC40 is best used as four-seater. At the rear, the seat for the middle passenger is raised and narrow, and the central tunnel eats into the legroom, making this space comfortable for shorter city drives only. Space around the driver is quite sufficient and the seats are comfy too; we drove for about four hours and didn’t feel fatigued at all.The country that gave the world Ikea should know a thing to two about space management, and Volvo has given this much thought in its new SUV. The designers haven’t placed the speakers in the doors, thus freeing up room for storage; the doors bins are large and can easily swallow bottles, magazines or even a laptop. The sub-woofer is mounted in the dashboard and is an air-vented unit (our colleagues over at What HiFi? say these are more power and space efficient). The sound system is by Harman Kardon and it sounds great. Other storage areas are large sized too, for example, the box under the armrest can hold a full-sized tissue box. Both the front seats get an under-seat tray, there are a few retractable shopping hooks, a dedicated phone storage space with an inductive charging pad and a small bin for waste paper. With the rear seats folded, boot space goes from 460 to 1,336 litres, and there’s also underfloor storage area in the boot that’s at 73 litres, with the spare tyre in place.What’s it like to drive?\\nWhen launched here, the XC40 will have a choice of two engines – a 190hp, 2.0-litre, four-cylinder diesel (D4) and a 247hp, 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol (T5), and we got to test both the versions. The engines are mated to eight-speed automatic gearboxes and, impressively, get all-wheel drive as standard. There is also a 150hp, 2.0-litre diesel (D3) with front-wheel drive that could come in at a later stage.Driving in Barcelona, we had a chance to sample the cars through city streets, highways and a bit of the hills too. The diesel isn’t a very lively performer but power delivery is nice and linear with no flat spots throughout the rev range. Cruising along at 100kph, the engine comfortably clocks 1,500rpm, but diesel clatter is quite audible and present across the rev range. The petrol engine is a livelier performer, but it feels rather coarse, lacking the kind of silky smoothness you’d be expecting. Performance, however, does satisfy. Dynamic and Comfort mode are sufficiently lively and it’s only the Eco mode that feels sedate; while this was well suited to the slow, orderly traffic in Spain, for the cut-and-thrust madness of our streets you’d probably want to use ‘Dynamic’. Volvo offer two chassis setups on the XC40 – a standard ‘Dynamic’ suspension setup, and a sharper handling ‘Sport’ setup which will be offered on the R-Design trim which is a sporty avatar that gets bits like a blacked-out roof and aluminium inlays in the cabin. Both are entertaining to drive, although body roll is present but it’s not to the point of being alarming or even uncomfortable. We didn’t get to drive both the setups over twisty sections, but the ‘Sport’ suspension with its firmer dampers did seem to offer a sharper feel. And what’s brilliant is that it does not compromise the ride quality. It, however, will be interesting to see how it fares on our roads.   Should I buy one?\\nLive a fun life? Then yes, you should. The XC40 handles well, is powered by decent engines and has plenty of great kit. Also given what we look for in SUVs, the tall height and long length only add to its appeal. And then there’s the super cool styling which will really tug at your heart strings. Of course, if your head also has a say, then the practical interiors, and the promise of good fuel efficiency will help. And what could work in its favour is keen pricing. Volvo has only recently started assembling cars in India, but the facility in Karnataka is setup to produce cars on the carmaker’s Scalable Platform Architecture (SPA), and the XC40’s Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) means it will remain imported – for now at least. However, true to Volvo’s form, expect a well-loaded car with competitive pricing, something in the range of Rs 37-42 lakh. It isn’t perfect though, space for five will be tight and Volvo’s dealer spread remains sparse across India. But for every other reason the XC40 will have you thinking, life indeed begins at 40.', 'ydney: If you think that sharing a peg with your teenaged son or daughter may teach them how to deal with alcohol responsibly and protect them from engaging in heavy drinking, you may be wrong. Instead, the practice may lead them to addiction, researchers have warned.Adolescents’ alcohol consumption, which is the leading factor for death and disability in teenagers globally, is of concern as this is when alcohol-use disorders are most likely to develop, the researchers said.The study, led by researchers from the University of New South Wales in Australia, showed that there were no benefits or protective effects associated with giving teenagers alcohol when compared with teenagers who were not given alcohol.Instead, parental provision of alcohol was associated with increased likelihood of teenagers accessing alcohol through other sources, compared with teenagers not given any alcohol.Importantly, teenagers supplied with alcohol by only their parents for one year were twice as likely to access alcohol from other sources the next year. “In many countries, parents are a key provider of alcohol to their children before they are of legal age to purchase alcohol. This practice by parents is intended to protect teenagers from the harm of heavy drinking by introducing them to alcohol carefully. However, the evidence behind this has been limited,” said Richard Mattick, Professor at the varsity.For the study, published in The Lancet Public Health journal, researchers recruited teenagers from secondary schools and their parents between 2010 and 2011. The teenagers and their parents completed separate questionnaires every year from 2010 to 2016 including information about how teenagers accessed alcohol, binge-drinking levels, experience of alcohol-related harm and alcohol-abuse symptoms.The six-year study of 1,927 teenagers aged 12 to 18 and their parents revealed that alcohol supplied by parents does not mitigate risk of its supply by other people, and that parental provision of alcohol did not appear to help teenagers deal with alcohol responsibly.', 'San Francisco: Microsoft has acquired gaming start-up PlayFab for an undisclosed sum and will integrate its services into Azure platform to help developers build better games.PlayFab powers more than 1,200 live games and has served over 700 million players.“Together, Azure and PlayFab will further unlock the power of the intelligent cloud for the gaming industry, enabling game developers and delighting gamers around the world,” Kareem Choudhry, Corporate Vice President of gaming at Microsoft, said in a blog post.PlayFab technology is being used by entertainment companies like Disney, NBC Universal, Wizards of the Coast, Nickelodeon, Bandai Namco, Rovio and Capcom.“Our platform of scalable game services, game analytics, and LiveOps tools are helping more than 3,000 studios progress from shipping static software to creating games that scale gracefully and evolve over time with new content, live events, and frequent updates,” PlayFab CEO James Gwertzman said in a post.PlayFab claims to process more than 1.5 billion transactions a day, nearly 20,000 transactions a second.“Microsoft, with its deep expertise in gaming and cloud computing, is a perfect home for PlayFab as we expand our platform and features,” Athe company said.“Microsoft’s global presence and world-class Microsoft Azure server infrastructure complement PlayFab’s services, making it even easier for studios to focus on building great games instead of back end technology,” it added.', 'New Delhi: Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s period drama Padmaavat has emerged victorious as the movie successfully entered the coveted Rs 100 crore club in flat four days.Noted film critic and trade analyst Taran Adarsh took to Twitter and shared the latest figures.#Padmaavat passes the crucial ‘Monday test’… Maintains the momentum… Collects a SOLID figure… Wed [limited previews] 5 cr, Thu 19 cr, Fri 32 cr, Sat 27 cr, Sun 31 cr, Mon 15 cr.

The film faced massive protests from certain fringe groups across the nation, demanding a pan India ban on the period drama.After braving all odds, Padmaavat hit the screens and managed to have preview shows days ahead of the nationwide release at some places.Amid tension and massive protests in the country, the film managed to gross exceptionally well internationally in Australia, UK and New Zealand. The film’s overseas collection in these countries (Paid review) has already beaten colossal hit Baahubali II: The Conclusion and Dangal respectively.With overseas figures already riding high at the Box Office, Padmaavat has got a big thumbs up from the audience.The film faced massive protests by fringe groups claiming that the filmmaker has distorted historical facts in the film. However, Bhansali time and again mentioned that none of these claims is true.The film was initially scheduled to hit the screens on December 1, 2017. It stars Deepika Padukone in the titular role of Rani Padmavati while Shahid Kapoor plays her on-screen husband Maharawal Ratan Singh. Ranveer Singh plays Alauddin Khilji in the period drama respectively.The impeccable performances of the lead actors have been appreciated by one and sundry.', 'Jaipur: Two of the four historians named by the Shree Rajput Karni Sena in a panel to watch Padmaavat have said the film does not hurt the sentiments of any caste and nobody should have a problem.RS Khangarot, the principal of Agarwal PG College in Jaipur, and B L Gupta, a retired professor of history at Rajasthan University, watched the movie in Bengaluru yesterday.“The film has nothing to do with history. I do not think it will hurt any section of society. The character of Rani Padmini in the film is not like the one in history,” Khangarot said.Gupta seconded the view of Khangarot.“I feel that nothing in the film would hurt the sentiments of any particular caste. Nobody should have a problem,” he said.Both the historians, however, said it was their personal opinion.Ahead of the release of Padmaavat on January 25, the Karni Sena had named four historians in the six-member panel and demanded that the film be screened for them.The other two historians are Jaipur’s Roshan Sharma and Delhi’s Kapil Kumar. The others in the panel are Vishwaraj Singh, a member of the erstwhile royal family of Mewar and Jagmal Singh, a member of the erstwhile royal family of Banswara.Khangarot and Gupta claimed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) had in December last year asked them to review the film but they could not watch it then.Vishwaraj Singh said he too was approached by the CBFC chairman. Shree Rajput Karni chief Sena Mahipal Singh Makrana said it made no sense that Padmaavat was screened for the historians after it was released.He said the panel was set up when the film had not hit the screens.Shree Rajput Sabha chief Giriraj Singh Lotwara said the historians, who watched the movie, claim it was not based on history, “then why the producers have named the protagonists on historical characters?”The Karni Sena has been at the forefront of protests against the Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed movie, alleging that the makers had distorted history.The group was not happy with censor board chief Prasoon Joshi’s decision to clear the film with modifications and three disclaimers, and continued with the protests even after the film’s release.The film, starring Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati and Ranveer Singh as Allaudin Khilji, hit the screens on January 25, after months of stiff opposition from right-wing groups.', 'New Delhi: Filmmaker Ali Abbas Zafar’s latest venture ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’ has witnessed a magical run at the Box Office which is still going strong.

Until now, such “chain migration” could extend to immigrants’ parents, grandparents, siblings and extended family.The White House said the policy was necessary to protect national security from terror and crime threats. ', 'Seoul: Pyongyang has cancelled one of the joint events it had agreed to hold with Seoul following a “historic” meeting earlier in January, and has blamed the South Korean media for it.In a fax on Monday, Pyongyang cancelled the celebration of the joint cultural performance, scheduled for February 4, accusing the South’s media of encouraging biased public sentiment towards the North, Efe news reported.Pyongyang’s decision on the scheduled event on Mount Kumgang during the PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games, was announced late on Monday, the South Korean Unification Ministry said on Tuesday.The Kim Jong-un regime accused the South’s media of producing “biased” reports about the upcoming event and an “internal event” of the regime, referring to the military parade it was preparing for February 8.For weeks, South Korean media have been analysing satellite images showing Pyongyang’s rehearsals for a large military parade, scheduled for the day before the opening of the PyeongChang Olympic Games.Both Koreas have agreed to march together for the first time in more than a decade.Some conservative politicians of Seoul criticised the military parade as a provocation.This was despite the fact that Seoul had extended its hand to the regime to participate in the Olympics and had suspended its joint military maneouvres with the US to defuse tension on the peninsula.“It is very regrettable,” the Unification Ministry said in a statement after hearing the decision.“What has been agreed must be implemented under the spirit of mutual respect and understanding as the South and the North have only taken a hard-earned first step toward improving the South-North relationship,” it added.The event at Mount Kumgang was to be part of a series of events to be held, along with the North Korean participation in the Winter Olympics.The two neighbours have technically remained at war since the 1950s and it was believed that this rapprochement could ease the regional tensions.The year 2017 was marked by the North’s consistent weapons tests and the US President Donald Trump’s belligerent rhetoric and threats, which the talks at the beginning of 2018 tried to ease.', 'Johannesburg: South Africa were dealt a major blow ahead of the six-match ODI series against India after star batsman AB de Villiers was on Tuesday ruled out of the first three matches due to a finger injury.South Africa have not named a replacement for the former skipper and hope to see him fully fit for the last three games.“De Villiers sustained the injury to his right index finger during the third Test against India and will require up to two weeks to make full recovery,” CSA said in a media release.“The CSA medical team is hopeful De Villiers will recover in time for the fourth `Pink` ODI at the Bidvest Wanderers Stadium on Saturday, February 10. The selectors have opted not to name a replacement,” the release added.The first match of the series takes place in Kingsmead on Thursday.', 'New Delhi: Top Indian shooters Jitu Rai, Gagan Narang and Apurvi Chandela were on Tuesday named in the country’s 27-member squad for the coming Commonwealth Games to be held in Gold Coast, Australia.The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) announced the full quota of 27 shooters (15 men and 12 women) after the Organising Committee of the Games reduced the country quotas across sports.India had fielded 30 shooters in the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games and bagged 17 medals (4 Gold, 9 Silver, 4 Bronze).Though most of the disciplines will be held in Gold Coast, shooting will be held at the Belmont Shooting Centre in Brisbane from April 8 to 14. There will be nine men’s and eight women’s events in the three disciplines of rifle, pistol and shotgun.Besides Rai and Narang, other top shooters among men include Sanjeev Rajput, Manvjit Singh Sandhu and Mohammed Asab.In the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, Rai had won a gold in the men’s 50m pistol event while Narang had bagged a silver and a bronze in the 50m rifle prone and 50m rifle 3 position events.Among women, experienced Heena Sidhu, promising youngsters Mehuli Ghosh and Manu Bhakar have also been named along with Chandela.Chandela had won a gold in women’s 10m Air Rifle event in Glasgow.“We have gone strictly by performance and merit as usual. For the Commonwealth Games, given the reduced quotas, it was tough to have to leave out a few shooters who had shot consistently well over the considered period and we went for consistent top ranks across multiple events,” NRAI President Raninder Singh said.“We believe we have a quality squad to match up and even better our performances of yesteryears. There are some exciting and extremely talented youngsters who will rub shoulders with established seniors and I am sure they will come out better with the experience,” he said.The NRAI also named squads for the six International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Cup stages of this year.The junior shooters who have made it to the Commonwealth Games squad have not been selected for the Junior World Cups in view of the importance attached to the CWG.Men’s Squad (15)\\n50m Rifle 3 Position: Sanjeev Rajput, Chain Singh\\n50m Rifle Prone: Chain Singh, Gagan Narang\\n10m Air Rifle: Ravi Kumar, Deepak Kumar\\n25m Rapid Fire Pistol: Anish, Neeraj Kumar\\n50m Free Pistol: Jitu Rai, Om Prakash Mitharwal\\n10m Air Pistol: Jitu Rai, Om Prakash Mitharwal\\nTrap: Manavjit Singh Sandhu, Kynan Chenai\\nDouble Trap: Mohd Asab, Ankur Mittal\\nSkeet: Smit Singh, Sheeraj SheikhWomen’s Squad (12)\\n50m Rifle 3 Position: Anjum Moudgil, Tejaswini Sawant\\n50m Rifle Prone: Anjum Moudgil, Tejaswini Sawant\\n10m Air Rifle: Apurvi Chandela, Mehuli Ghosh\\n25m Sports Pistol: Heena Sidhu, Annuraj Singh\\n10m Air Pistol: Heena Sidhu, Manu Bhaker\\nTrap: Shreyasi Singh, Seema Tomar\\nDouble Trap: Shreyasi Singh, Varsha Varman\\nSkeet: Saniya Sheikh, Maheshwari Chauhan', 'NEW DELHI: Veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Yashwant Sinha Tuesday launched a new political platform – ‘Rashtra Manch’- to start a movement against the policies of the Central government.BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha along with Trinamool Congress MP Dinesh Trivedi, Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury, NCP MP Majeed Memon, Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh, former Gujarat chief minister Suresh Mehta and JD(U) leader Pavan Varma were also present at the launch of the front.Speaking at the event, Shatrughan Sinha said that he had joined the forum because he is not being given a chance to express his views in the party. However, he said that his support to Yashwant Sinha should not be seen as an anti-party activity as it was in national interest.Emphasising the importance of the Rashtra Manch, Yashwant Sinha likened the present situation to that which prevailed 70 years ago when Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated. He stated that democracy and its institutions were under attack.Hitting out at the Narendra Modi government, he said that the Centre had reduced farmers to “the status of beggars” and accused it of presenting “made to order” statistics to suit its interests.The senior leader claimed that the ‘Rashtra Manch’ would be a non-party political action group, which will work to highlight national issues.“It is not an organisation but a national movement,” he said, hitting out at the government’s economic and foreign policies.“Everybody in the BJP is living in fear. We are not,” he said.Dialogue and debate in the country had become “course, one-sided and dangerous”, he added.“It seems mob has the job of giving justice,” he claimed.The first leg of the Budget Session of Parliament would effectively have only four working days, something that was unprecedented, he said.Taking up farmers’ issues would be the top priority of his organisation, said the 80-year-old leader, who had held the finance and external affairs portfolios in the first NDA government. ', 'New York: Adult film star Stormy Daniels, in the midst of a publicity tour fuelled by past allegations of a 2006 sexual relationship with a then-married Donald Trump, said in a statement the alleged affair never occurred.A lawyer for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, confirmed the statement was authentic but didn’t offer any further details.The statement comes at a curious time for Clifford, who is scheduled to appear following the president’s State of the Union address on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”In recent weeks she has changed production companies, given a television interview and promoted strip club appearances with a risque play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer, has denied there was any affair.Clifford’s allegation, first made in 2011 and then again a month before the election, went mostly unnoticed until The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Cohen brokered a USD 130,000 payment to Clifford to keep her from publicly discussing it.A week after that report, In Touch magazine printed a 5,000-word interview it conducted with Clifford in 2011 but never published after Cohen threatened the tabloid with a lawsuit.In that interview, Clifford described a single sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, when he was recently married to his third wife, Melania, as well as a subsequent years-long relationship with the reality TV star. The magazine said it corroborated her account with friends and said she passed a lie detector test.In her statement today, Clifford said she wasn’t denying the affair because she was paid “hush money,” but rather “because it never happened.”Neither Cohen nor Clifford has addressed whether she was paid USD 130,000, or if so, why.A publicist didn’t respond to questions about the statement today. ', 'New Delhi: The last full Union Budget to be presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday will be unlike his previous four such exercises because of the complete overhaul of the indirect tax regime effected by implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) last year.However, in the area of direct taxes like income tax and corporate tax, Jaitley has hinted at some relief for taxpayers as he made a case for rationalisation of the direct tax structure considering the fact that “the tax base has expanded”.“In income tax, the base has become larger; it’s bound to enlarge. And, therefore, charging higher rates from few selected groups — which has traditionally been done — is an area which has been changing,” Jaitley had said.It is widely expected that common man may get some relief in income tax by way of a raise in the exemption limit from the current level of Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh per annum.In his last Budget, Jaitley proposed to reduce existing rate of taxation of those with income between Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh from 10 percent to 5 percent in the Budget.However, he announced a 10 percent surcharge on individual income above Rs 50 lakh and upto Rs 1 crore to make up for Rs 15,000 crore loss of due to cut in personal I-T rate. Additionally, the 15 percent surcharge on income above Rs 1 crore will continue.Furthermore, it is also expected that the finance minister to double the medical reimbursement limit from current Rs 15,000 was to Rs 30,000 per annum.Another major expectation from Jaitley is on increasing the limit of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act that helps in increasing savings of individuals. The deduction limit from Rs 1.5 lakh per year should be increased to Rs 2 lakh to encourage savings under various instruments like PPF, tax-saving FDs etc.', 'Jammu: In an apparent reference to Kashmir Deputy Mufti Azam Nasir-Ul-Islam’s suggestion, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday denounced demand to have a separate state for Muslims.“J&K was neither a party to the partition of our country nor did we support division on religious lines. We as a state opted for the opposite, but unfortunately are still paying the price. I strongly condemn any statement made asking for Muslims in India to demand a separate state,” she posted on Twitter, though she did not name anyone.J&K was neither a party to the partition of our country nor did we support division on religious lines.

I strongly condemn any statement made asking for Muslims in India to demand a separate state.— Mehbooba Mufti (@MehboobaMufti) January 31, 2018On Tuesday, Nasir-ul-Islam had alleged that Muslims in the country were living a “pathetic” life and they should demand a separate state within India.“Muslims are being harassed in India in the name of love jihad, cow vigilantism and what not. The population of Muslims is second largest in India. Pakistan was formed with only 17 crore people. If the Muslims continue to suffer in India, then we will have to form a new country. The Muslim community should ask for a separate country,” he had said.Nasir-Ul-Islam had further said that the government was not paying heed to the problems of the Muslim community.“Indian Muslims are living in a pathetic condition. Government is not listening to them. So what is the way out? Way out is to separate from India,” he had said.', 'NEW DELHI: The Congress has laughed off the allegations of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that party chief Rahul Gandhi wore a jacket worth Rs 70,000. Giving no importance to the issue, senior Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury said that similar jackets can be found for Rs 700 too. “I can show you the same jacket for Rs 700,’ she said.Taking a ‘soot-boot ki sarkar’ jibe at the Congress chief, BJP’s Meghalaya unit had posted the photo of Rahul donning the jacket on Twitter at a music event in Shillong on Tuesday. “So @OfficeOfRG, soot (pun intended!)-boot ki sarkar with ‘black’ money fleeced from Meghalayan State exchequer by rampant corruption?

Along with traditional ceremonies, Sanskrit shlokas were recited from the Atharva Veda at the launch.  This historic event is a step ahead in the ongoing ‘Make In India’ programme which is being actively implemented by the Department of Defence Production (MoD).The submarine was towed to Mumbai Port Trust, for separation from the pontoon. Karanj will now undergo rigorous trials and tests, both in harbour and at sea before it is commissioned into the Navy. Here are 10 things you must know about the Scorpene-class submarine:The launch of Karanj marks a significant departure from the manning and training philosophy that was adopted for the first two submarines.\\nAdmiral Sunil Lanba said from third submarine onwards the Navy would be fully self reliant in training and certification processes.\\nThe state-of-the-art technology used for the construction of the Scorpene class submarines has ensured superior stealth features such as advanced acoustic silencing techniques, low radiated noise levels, hydro-dynamically optimized shape.\\nIt also has the ability to launch a crippling attack on the enemy using precision-guided weapons.\\nScorpene submarines can undertake multifarious types of missions i.e Anti-Surface warfare, Anti-Submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, mine laying, area surveillance etc.\\nThe submarine is designed to operate in all theatres, with means provided to ensure interoperability with other components of a Naval Task Force\\nThe indigenous Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) will not be incorporated in vessels five and six as orignally planned but retrofitted on all six boats at a later stage.

Since the inception of the show, he has, on many occasions, talked about the challenges faced by students and even encouraged them to overcome those challenges. And now, the Prime Minister is coming up with a book for them.Yes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has written a book for students who battle stress and anxiety during examinations. The book, slated to be released on February 3, talks about the ways in which students can tackle the stress.The book has been titled ‘Exam Warriors’ and mentions various means such as practicing yoga.The book is being brought out by publishing major Penguin.It lays special stress on the challenges faced by students who appear for class 10 and class 12 board examination. The Prime Minister, in his book, talks about why knowledge should be given priority over marks secured in examinations.The book, which has been conceptualised by PM Modi himself, would encourage students to take up education in a manner that would strengthen and build their future.The cover page of the book has also been released.', 'NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is all set to deliver his last full Budget on Friday. And it is likely that he will deliver his speech in Hindi, the first time ever for a Finance Minister to do so since Independence. The move is likely to cater to the rural audience as this is the last full Budget of the Narendra Modi government before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.By giving out his speech in Hindi, Jaitley will try to establish that the Budget is for the common man and has a greater connect with people, the Deccan Chronicle reported.The current NDA government’s fifth will arguably be Jaitley’s toughest Budget yet as he seeks to address agriculture distress, create jobs and boost growth while at the same time stick to fiscal prudence.The Budget, in view of upcoming assembly polls in eight states – including three major states ruled by the BJP – and general elections next year, may see new rural schemes and stepping up of funding towards existing programmes like MNREGA, rural housing, irrigation projects and crop insurance.There is also an expectation that common man may get some relief in income tax by way of a raise in the exemption limit.Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed to have already lowered expectations of mass voter swaying announcements when he indicated that the Budget may not be resort to populism and that it was a myth that common man wants sop.This will be India’s first post-GST and is being keenly watched to see what Jaitley does to boost growth in Asia’s third largest economy.', 'Mercedes-Benz has teased a new image of its A-class hatchback, which is scheduled for a reveal next month. The image shows a darkly-lit A-class, revealing new headlights that echo those on the recently launched CLS. Autocar UK, has lightened the photo, giving the clearest indication yet of the revamped front end, which has been designed to give the car a bold, aggressive look. Underpinning the new A-class is the new MFA-2 platform, which features greater use of aluminium and high-strength steel than the MFA platform on which it is based. The car features a wide and relatively low-set grille with horizontal louvres, together with relatively thin headlamps that extend back into the front wings to provide the front end with a heavily tapered appearance.The new A-class retains the practical five-door layout of its predecessor, although it has grown dimensionally; length is up by 120mm at 4,419mm, while width increases by 16mm to around 1,796mm. It also adopts a 30mm longer wheelbase at 2,729mm.The engine line-up for the A-class consists of the base 1.4-litre engine (codenamed M282) which is planned to come in three states of tune – 110hp in the A 140, 136hp in the A 160 and 163hp in the A 180. Above it is the 2.0-litre engine (codename M260) that is planned to deliver 191hp in the A200 and 224hp in the A250.The new M260 petrol unit also forms the basis of a new engine from AMG for the A 35 4Matic model, which gets a 48-volt electric architecture that allow an electric boost function and an output of 306hp along with a sturdy 409Nm of torque.Though nothing is official just yet, Autocar UK has been told that the A 45 4Matic’s successor is based on a reworked version of the A 35’s engine with mild-hybrid properties and will tuned to deliver in the region of 408hp.', 'London: People with high blood sugar may experience steep long-term cognitive decline than their healthy peers, a study suggests.The study of about 5,000 older people in the UK has shown that efforts to delay the onset of diabetes and/or control blood sugar levels might prevent subsequent progression of brain function decline.While other studies have linked cognitive decline with diabetes, the new study is one of the largest to establish the direct relationship between the levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) – a measure of overall blood sugar control – and subsequent risk of cognitive decline, researchers said.The team from Imperial College London in the UK and Peking University in China used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for their analysis.Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and reassessed every two years. Computer modelling was then used to establish any possible associations.The study contained 5,189 participants (55 percent women, mean age 66 years) with baseline HbA1c levels ranging from 15.9 to 126.3 mmol/mol (3.6-13.7 percent).A mole is an amount of a substance that contains a large number (6 followed by 23 zeros) of molecules or atoms.Current cut-offs for defining diabetes using HbA1c are 6.5 percent and above, researchers said.The mean follow-up duration was eight years and the mean number of cognitive assessments was five.The analysis revealed that a one mmol/mol increase in HbA1c was significantly associated with an increased rate of decline in global cognitive z scores, memory z scores and executive function z scores, all signs of cognitive function decline.While cognitive function declined with age in all of the participants, whether diabetic or not, compared with participants with normal blood sugar control, the global cognitive decline associated with prediabetes and diabetes was significantly increased, researchers found.Similarly, memory, executive function and orientation z scores showed an increased rate of cognitive decline with diabetes.Significantly, the rate of cognitive decline was directly linked to a person’s HbA1c status (with a higher HbA1c meaning higher rate of cognitive decline), whether or not they were diabetic according to their HbA1c status at baseline, researchers said.', 'Tokyo: Slower-than-expected sales have forced Apple to slash iPhone X production by half for the January-March period — to 20 million units from the earlier planned 40 million units, the media reported.According to a report in Nikkei Asian Review on Tuesday, the Cupertino-based giant has notified suppliers that it had decided to cut the iPhone manufacturing by 50 percent owing to slower-than-expected sales in Europe, the US and China.“With components deliveries delayed, Apple had struggled to keep up with demand for the iPhone X immediately after its launch. Rising inventories appear to have pushed the company to sharply slow production,” the report added.“Looking forward, the lacklustre sales could result in a delay to the company’s plans to introduce OLED screens in other iPhone models,” the report noted.South Korean giant Samsung that currently provides OLED panels for $999 iPhone X will also be hit as its orders will also be affected.The production cuts for iPhone X, said the report, will have a domino effect on manufacturers that supply high-performance components for the handset, acewith the combined impact expected to run into billions of dollars for the January-March quarter alone”.Apple’s 10th-anniversary “super-premium” smartphone went on sale across the globe on November 3.Earlier this month, an analyst associated with Taiwanese business group KGI Securities said that more sluggish-than-expected response may lead Apple to discontinue the first-generation iPhone X around mid-2018 as the second-generation model is set for launch later this year.According to Ming-Chi Kuo, the most famous analyst with KGI Securities when it comes to Apple, the Cupertino-based giant will not sell iPhone X at lower price as it will hurt its other products in the lower-priced premium segment.Kuo estimated that Apple would ship about 18 million iPhone X units in the January-March quarter in 2018.“We expect iPhone X will go to end of life (EOL) around mid-2018 and that total life cycle shipments will be around 62 million units, lower than our previous forecast of 80 million units,” the analyst said.Apple shipped 29 million iPhone X units in the fourth quarter of 2017, Singapore-based market research firm Canalys said, adding that this made iPhone X the world’s best-shipping smartphone model over the holiday season.“The iPhone X performance is impressive for a device priced at $999, but it is slightly below industry expectations,” said Ben Stanton, analyst at Canalys.', 'Kochi: Sujith Venugopal (26), an interior designer in Kochi, was beaten to death by auto driver Mithun (32) who questioned him for stalking his cousin at Irinjalakkuda near here.

', 'Durban: Galvanised by the consolatory win in the final Test, a resurgent India will be aiming for their first bilateral ODI series triumph on the South African soil when they take on the Proteas in a six-match rubber, starting on Thursday.With only 14 months to go for the 2019 ODI World Cup, India will also look to kick off their preparations in earnest during the series.India have a long limited-overs’ schedule until their next big Test assignment this year.They play six ODIs and three Twenty20 Internationals here, a T20I tri-series in Sri Lanka and then three ODIs and three T20Is in England and Ireland, with the 2018 IPL season thrown in, before the five-Test series in England later in August.Such a definitive run of limited-overs’ cricket, especially in overseas conditions in South Africa and England, will allow the Indian team management to round up the squad’s core for the big tournament in 2019 and fix up certain spots which still need some work.At the same time, the Men in Blue will be intent on winning their first-ever bilateral ODI series on South African soil.India have previously lost 2-5 in 1992-93, 0-4 in 2006- 07, 2-3 in 2010-11 and 0-2 in 2013-14. They were also part of two triangular series in 1996-97 and 2001-02, featuring Zimbabwe and Kenya respectively, but the Proteas emerged victors on both occasions.So much so, India’s ODI record against South Africa in South Africa is heavily skewered.In 28 meetings since 1992-93, the Proteas have won 21 matches, while India have only won five. Such a poor record will not sit well with the current team management that is intent on improving India’s all-round showing in overseas conditions.Additionally, India have a very lop-sided ODI record at Durban. In seven ODIs against South Africa at this venue, since 1992-93, they have lost six with one no-result. India did beat England and Kenya here though, during the 2003 ODI World Cup, giving them an overall two wins in nine ODIs at Kingsmead.At stake, there is also the small matter of achieving the no.1 spot in ICC’s ODI rankings. Currently, South Africa sit atop with 120 points while India are second with 119 points. While the ODI rankings change after every match, a cumulative 4-2 series’ win will be enough to help India achieve the no.1 spot.This should be motivation enough for Virat Kohli and Co., particularly as they will be taking the momentum into this ODI series, having assured themselves of finishing no.1 in the ICC Test rankings by prolonging their unbeaten record at the Wanderers last week.South Africa won the Test series 2-1, but lost the third Test at Johannesburg by 63 runs on a seam-friendly pitch rated ‘poor’ by ICC match referee Andy Pycroft.India also have a proud ODI record to protect. Since losing 1-4 in Australia (January 2016), the Men in Blue haven’t lost a single bilateral ODI series, home or away.In this interim, they have beaten Zimbabwe, New Zealand (twice), England, West Indies, Sri Lanka (twice) and Australia, winning 24 out of 32 bilateral matches.Their only tournament loss came in the 2017 Champions Trophy (in England), where they lost to Pakistan in the final.As such, the team management will be relying on optimal selection to get this six-match series off to a good start. With the return of Kohli after missing the ODIs/T20Is series against Sri Lanka in December, there is only one middle-order spot to be decided.Shreyas Iyer gave a good account of himself, scoring two half-centuries in three matches against Sri Lanka, and is a front-runner for the job. But experience could be of greater value herein, with Dinesh Karthik and Manish Pandey also in the running.On Wednesday, the pitch bore a brownish look ahead of the game, in keeping with the rainfall Durban has received of late.Showers are forecast for Thursday’s game as well. It might have a bearing on how many spinners India go in with.If the visitors play only a lone spinner, Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav could get the nod ahead of both Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal, to counter the threat of big-hitting left- handers David Miller and JP Duminy in the middle-order.Only one spinner would also mean that Kedar Jadhav is assured of a starting spot, thanks to his part-time bowling.South Africa too, meanwhile, have an eye on the upcoming World Cup. AB de Villiers is set to miss out the first 3 ODIs due to an injured right index finger (sustained during the third Test).Farhan Behardien is usually their go-to batsman in such situations, but he wasn’t called upon ON this occasion. This is indicative of the Proteas’ team management eyeing different combinations.Durban-born batsman Khayelihle Zondo can expect to make his debut instead. The other option is to open with Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock and give Aiden Markram another opportunity in the middle-order, wherein he had scored 66 on ODI debut against Bangladesh at East London (October 2017). The Proteas are expected to go in with only spinner – Imran Tahir.SQUADSIndia: Virat Kohli (capt), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (wk), Hardik Pandya, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Shardul ThakurSouth Africa: Faf du Plessis (capt), Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock (wk), JP Duminy, Imran Tahir, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Lungisani Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi, Khayelihle Zondo', 'Karachi: Ramiz Raja has praised the role of legendary batsman Rahul Dravid in developing the young Indian players and said Pakistan needs someone like him to unearth talent. Lamenting the 203-run defeat at the hands of India in the semifinals of the ICC U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, Ramiz said he was pretty shocked at the margin of loss.The 1992 World Cup-winner admitted that India’s big win was not surprising given the fact that Indian youngsters were better groomed and prepared to handle pressure situations.“I am impressed with the temperament shown by some of the Indian players. They have a fine find in Shubman Gill and others. Rahul Dravid deserves a lot of credit for preparing and grooming them so effectively,” he said.Ramiz said having someone like Dravid as their coach and mentor was a big boost for the Indian youngsters.“They learn such a lot from him not just about cricket but about everything else. How to conduct oneself, how to develop the game-sense and so on,” he said.Ramiz said he was disappointed with the lack of batting talent in the Pakistan U-19 team.“The way our players fielded and batted, it wasn’t pleasant to watch. I think in Pakistan we need a total revamp of our youth cricket system. The cricket board needs to pay a lot more attention to youth cricket,” he said.Ramiz said a respected former stalwart of Pakistan cricket should be given the responsibility of developing the young players.“We need to give someone charge for a proper time period like India has done with Rahul Dravid,” he said.Ramiz said youth cricket was not about winning but more importantly about scouting new players and then developing them for the future.', 'Durban: On the eve of the first ODI against South Africa here on Thursday, India captain Virat Kohli said experimentation in the middle order will continue for some more time, though the conditions make Ajinkya Rahane a strong No. 4 candidate for the World Cup in England next year.India will be trying to win their first bilateral ODI series in the rainbow nation and will depend a lot on their explosive white-ball batsmen to put the hosts under pressure. While the series will be another chapter in the team’s preparation for the 2019 World Cup, Kohli said the core group of players is in place and only the No. 4 spot really needs to be sorted out.South Africa take on India in first of the six-match ODI series in Durban on Thursday. The Indian team had an optional practice session on Wednesday, with Kohli and pace bowlers taking a day off.“We have explored many options in the last few months. We don’t have too many series and too much time left before the World Cup, so we want to explore all the options before that,” Kohli told reporters on Wednesday.“I had said earlier that Rahane would be looked at as a third opener but that situation can change because he has batted at No. 4 in a World Cup (in 2015) before. These conditions are such that you get to play fast bowling throughout the innings, so he becomes a strong candidate for No. 4.“Other than him, we have Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey. We don’t want to be one-dimensional. It depends whose technique is more suited to what spot, especially in that particular country. All options are open,” he said further.“Although the lower middle order is more or less sorted, the middle order is something we are still looking at. The combination is working well for us with Hardik Pandya, Kedar Jadhav and MS Dhoni rotating and batting together.“No. 4 is something we have experimented with in the last couple of series. That is the only spot I can see that needs to be solidified, otherwise the team looks pretty balanced,” he added.Kohli stressed that although the core group of players has been identified, things could still change in lead-up to the World Cup.He also added that there is a need to find a balance between preparations and the challenge of current series.“It’s about who takes that one particular spot (number four). It’s not even spots above and below. Guys who are given the opportunity need to capitalise and really string in performances that convince the management and the team that the guy is meant to play at that spot for the team.“I feel the core of players is more or less pretty strong at the moment. Obviously, changes can happen at any stage. You don’t know whether someone is going to be in form or not or what the team requires at certain stages,” he said.Kohli said that the squad has enough quality even if there is some experimentation to be done.“It is about finding players who fit a particular spot better in certain conditions. That will be our mindset. We will play the World Cup in England, which will be very different to what we get in India.“People who might be doing well at home might not necessarily repeat their performances in England. It’s very different. We will have to figure out which players’ game suits the team best in particular conditions that we play, at a particular spot.“I don’t think the quality of the team will be compromised in any way regardless of who takes the No. 4 position because we have strong batsmen above and below to stabilise the innings,” said the skipper.Talking about the series in question, the Indian skipper said that this would be a tough assignment for India’s legspinners who are playing in foreign conditions for the first time.“We are one of the few teams, or probably the only team in world cricket, to be blessed with two wrist spinners, while Kedar Jadhav is doing the conventional job pretty well for the team. Wrist spinners help you in any conditions in the world.“Wrist spinners can go for six an over but they will pick you three wickets as well, which is eventually the difference in the game,” said Kohli.India have a poor ODI record in South Africa, having only won 5 out of 27 ODIs they have played against South Africa in South Africa, have never won a bilateral series here or indeed beaten South Africa at Durban in ODI cricket.“We obviously want to win every series that we play. Thinking of records or doing something that hasn’t been done before is not something you think of before achieving it. It just adds extra pressure, which is not needed.“But yes, we took a lot of confidence from that last Test. As batsmen obviously, everyone is looking forward to stepping up – like in the last Test how we believed in ourselves and ended up winning the Test. We have to carry the same belief throughout this series.”Kohli expects the pitches to be much more batting friendly in ODIs than what was seen in the Test series.“The wickets are going to be much better than the Test series, because of the format and this pitch looks pretty balanced I would say for a good game of cricket.”Kohli was asked about the various differences between leading in Test and ODI cricket, after being named captain in ICC’s annual teams in both formats. The skipper said that there is a great bunch of players available to the team management at the moment.“In ODI cricket, you have to think more, at every moment. In Test cricket, the game has a pattern, and it goes with a flow and a speed. So you can figure out in which session when the momentum shifts. But in ODI cricket, it can be over to over. So you have to always stay ahead of the game.“One advantage as a batsman is I can think like one and figure out what must be going through their minds. You have to be on top of the game and do things proactively first rather than later.”Before picking a player, the character is given more importance than skills, said Kohli.“For us as team management, and myself, we look at characters before we look at skill. We look at a guy who scored 40 when the team needed it the most, compared to a guy who has scored runs but they might not have affected the state of the game that much.“We look for game-changers, we look for guys who embrace pressure, we look for guys who want to be in difficult situations because in one-day cricket you don’t have another day to come back and do something extra.

During this period, 11,581 transporters registered themselves under the system.', 'Caracas: Venezuela on Wednesday said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “went too far” by referring a century-old border dispute with Guyana to the International Court of Justice.Venezuela has been pressing a historic claim to Guyana’s Essequibo region, which encompasses two-thirds of the former British colony since US oil giant Exxon Mobil discovered oil in off its coast in 2015.Guterres sent the case to the ICJ yesterday following a failed UN-sponsored attempt that was aimed at brokering a settlement between Venezuela and Guyana by the end of 2017.“Guterres went too far” by attempting to bypass the Geneva Agreement, a 1966 border dispute deal that Venezuela reached with then-colonial power Britain, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said.Guyana’s foreign ministry said yesterday that it welcomed Guterres’s decision, adding that the ICJ is the “appropriate forum for the peaceful and definitive settlement of the controversy.”Guyana maintains that valid land borders were set in 1899 by an arbitration court decision, a decision Venezuela has never recognized.The announcement in May 2015 of a significant discovery of high-quality oil in an offshore concession 190 kilometres off Guyana set off a round of recriminations between Venezuela and its eastern neighbor.Guyana is pressing ahead with plans to drill for oil in the disputed waters, with production expected to begin in mid-2020.', 'WASHINGTON: A train traveling from Washington to West Virginia carrying Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday collided with a garbage truck but only minor injuries were sustained on the train, according to a source on the train.There were a “few bumps and bruises” sustained by passengers, said the source who asked not to be identified, and provided the information by email.The train was taking lawmakers to an annual retreat being held this year in West Virginia.', 'The Chinese government has expanded its bullying of countries that have allegedly printed or displayed ‘problem maps’ of its territory. It has issued warnings, notices and imposed fines on eight companies that allegedly published maps that didn’t include that China claims as its own – like Taiwan, the South China Sea islands and the Senkaku Islands.This latest round of governmental action on maps comes close on the heels of similar targeting over foreign companies in China. US hotel chain Marriott, Delta Airlines and the clothing brand Zara have all faced trouble in recent weeks.China’s National Administration of Surveying, Mapping, and Geoinformation (NASMG) handed out the notices, warning and fines to eight companies, including Japanese brand-less retailer Muji and Chinese news portal ifeng.com. Chinese media have referred to this as a ‘shame list’.These eight cases of ‘problem maps’ were all found to have ‘seriously damaged the sovereignty and interests of the country’. How did achieve this? They did not include the South China Sea Islands, the Diaoyu Islands, Chiwei Island or Taiwan.All of these islands are disputed. China is locked in territorial disputes with nine countries in the South China Sea; with Japan over Chiwei Island and the Senkaku Islands (China refers to them as Diaoyu), and has claimed Taiwan as its own ever since the Peoples Republic of China came into existence. Also, except the islands in the South China Sea, which it has artificially expanded, China holds no control over any of the islands in question – Taiwan has functioned as a separate country since 1949, and Japan has full control over the Senkaku Islands and Chiwei.The eight companies that have been put on the shame list are Muji, marketing consultant Hua&Hua, Hongtong Network; news portal ifeng.com for ‘misrepresentation’ on its ‘Interactive Belt and Road Risk Map’; toy maker Longchang Company for its ‘problem globes’; state-run Hunan Normal University Press for errors in high school geography textbooks; Hubei Beier Publishing for wrongly labelling Tibet a British territory; and 21st Century Publishing Group for leaving out Taiwan in a children’s book.Some of these map offenders have been ordered to conduct National Territory Awareness Education for staff.The action is being taken in line with the Regulations on the Administration of Map Management issued by the Chinese government in November 2015. The regulations had made it a legal requirement to make all published maps subject to inspection by authorities.American companies operating in China have faced a recent series of troubles with the administration over the question of sovereignty.

The statement by Pentagon Pentagon’s chief spokesperson Dana White came on Thursday amid Pakistani newspaper reports suggesting a possible US crackdown inside the country.Lauding India for its “help with respect to the South Asian strategy”, the Pentagon said that the America’s relationship with it is “multifaceted”. White hailed India for providing “a tremendous amount of developmental aid”.“Our relationship with India is multifaceted. India is helping with respect to the South Asian Strategy. They’ve provided a tremendous amount of developmental aid. They’ve also offered to help with aviation maintenance,” said White.“There’s an opportunity. India’s a perfect example of where the (defence) secretary wants to find and build relationships with partners, and so that’s what we are doing. And with respect to the South Asia Strategy, they are a key player in ensuring its success,” White said.The US also reached out to Pakistan, saying the US looks “to gain Pakistani cooperation and assistance”.Under the new South Asia strategy, Pakistan has an opportunity to be a partner in fight against terrorism, Pentagon’s Chief Spokesperson Dana White said.“It (Pakistan) has been a victim of terrorism, and it has supported terrorism. We are looking for Pakistan to actively join — it can do the things we need them to do to confront terrorism,” said White.“So it’s an inflection point, it’s an opportunity, and we hope Pakistan will take it,” she said in response to a question.Joint Staff Director Lt Gen Kenneth F McKenzie said, “Through a variety of measures, we look to gain Pakistani cooperation and assistance as we pursue operations in Afghanistan.

We have to be alert on the violence being spread over religion and caste and many other issues that are of national concern and we all have to come together leaving aside differences,” she said as per Azad.Sonia also sought to garner the support of Opposition parties to put up a united front to plan a joint strategy for the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and work towards larger Opposition unity to take on the BJP in upcoming polls.Asked if the meeting was the beginning of forming UPA-3, he said, “I will not say UPA-3.”This is the first time Sonia led an Opposition meet after handing over the baton of Congress president to her son Rahul Gandhi. She continues to be the chairperson of the Congress parliamentary party and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA).The meeting, held at the Parliament library building, is seen as part of efforts to galvanise the support of all 17 parties most of which had come together during the presidential and vice presidential polls against the BJP.Meanwhile, Rahul also stressed on the point that while there may be differences among some parties in different states, these should be resolved amicably among different constituents.It was also discussed at the meeting that it was natural for those parties who are not part of the government and did not believe in NDA ideology to come together under one front to take on the NDA, PTI reported.Top leaders who attended the meeting included former prime minister Manmohan Singh, senior Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mallikarjun Kharge, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel, National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah, TMC’s Derek O’Brien, CPI national secretary D Raja, Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav and Naresh Agrawal, besides CPI-M’s Mohammed Salim and TK Rangarajan.JD-S leader Kupendra Reddy, breakaway JD-U leader Sharad Yadav, RLD’s Ajit Singh, RJD’s Misa Bharati and Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav, JMM’s Sanjiv Kumar, AIUDF’s Badruddin Ajmal, Kerala Congress’s Joy Abrahim, IUML’s PK Kunhalikutti and RPS’s N K Premchandran were also present at the meet.', 'New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley did not provide any relief in the income tax rates in the Union Budget 2018-19.

Also, other medical reimbursement benefits in case of hospitalisation etc., for all employees shall continue.Jaitley has said that the total number of salaried employees and pensioners who will benefit from this decision is around 2.5 crore.Experts believe that the move to announce standard deduction of Rs 40,000 apart from reducing paper work and compliance, will help middle class employees even more in terms of reduction in their tax liability.

It is expected that at least 8 lakh shops and a large number of factories would remain closed as part of the strike.The call for two-day bandh has been given by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). Notably, the Chamber of Trade and Industries (CTI) had called for a three-day bandh. The CTI has also planned to hold a protest and ‘katora march’ in front of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) office at Kashmiri Gate.The CAIT, on the other hand, has decided to hold protest march in all markets in the national capital. They are slated to stage a protest at Bikanerwala crossing in Karol Bagh area at around noon.At around the same time, a ‘chakka jam’ is also expected to be staged at Paharganj near New Delhi Railway Station. This might lead to trouble for those going to the railway station.Both the traders’ bodies have declared that the protests would end only after the government implements the announcements made by Minister of State for Housing & Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday.The traders are also keenly awaiting a meeting of Delhi Development Authority (DDA) board, scheduled for later on Thursday. New proposals for amendments in Master Plan 2021, that would give relief from sealing, are expected to be tabled in the meet.One of the proposals expected to be tabled in the meeting is increasing the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) from 180 to 300-350. There might also be a proposal on unifying the FAR. There might also be a proposal for relief in the conversion charge and penalty.According to sources, public opinion is likely to be sought on proposals tabled in the meeting, following which they would be notified officially.This comes a day after Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken on Thursday made a presentation before the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee, raising demand for halting the ongoing sealing of illegal commercial establishments in the city.Maken said the sealing drive was “illegal” and quoted the law and the Delhi Master Plan 2021 to support his claim.“We are hopeful that no sealing in Special Areas and Village Abadi areas of Delhi will take place,” he said after the meeting with the monitoring committee members.On Tuesday, Maken had sought an appointment with the committee to present his legal stand for halting the sealing drive.Maken had said he may approach the Supreme Court if needed be. “If the monitoring committee does not listen to me, I will move the Supreme Court to make my submissions.”Several commercial establishments in Delhi have been sealed by BJP-ruled civic bodies for failing to deposit conversion charges according to provisions in the master plan.(With PTI Inputs)', 'Kia has issued teaser images of the SP Concept, a preview of its made-for-India SUV, which will make its debut at the Auto Expo 2018.The carmaker has said the SP Concept will be “inspired by Indian heritage” and take the company’s design language in a “bold and sophisticated direction”.What can be gleaned from the pictures is that the SP Concept – as we’d reported earlier – will be a rival to its cousin, the Hyundai Creta. It will sport all-LED lights front and back, a prominent waistline, sloping roofline, beefy wheel arches and a contrast roof, which seems to be the new ‘in’ thing.While details are scarce at the moment, we hear the SP Concept could be based on a new platform that will also underpin the all-new Creta that is due in 2020. As Hyundai plans to offer the second-generation Creta in five- and seven-seat configurations, Kia could opt to do the same.What is also a possibility is the introduction of a new 1.5-litre, BS-VI-compliant diesel engine, which the SP Concept could share with the new Creta, along with the 1.6-litre petrol, which could be offered with some form of electrification. Gearbox options could include a six-speed manual and six-speed automatic, also shared with the Creta.The Concept SP will be produced at Kia’s 536-acre plant in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, and the production car will likely arrive in the second half of 2019.In addition to the concept, Kia will showcase 16 other models – including the Stinger sports sedan, EVs, and plug-in hybrids – at Hall 7, at the upcoming Auto Expo.', 'New York: Are you suffering from heart disease? A treatment with Vitamin D3 might help restore damage to your cardiovascular system, finds a study.Vitamin D3 is produced naturally when skin is exposed to the sun or through over-the-counter pills. Several diseases, including high blood pressure, build-up of fats, cholesterol in and on the artery walls, and diabetes, can cause damage to the cardiovascular system thus increasing the risk of heart attack.However, taking Vitamin D3 — associated with the bones — at doses higher than those currently used for the treatment of bone diseases may be highly beneficial for the treatment of the dysfunctional cardiovascular system, the study showed.“Generally, Vitamin D3 is associated with the bones. However, in recent years, in clinical settings, people recognise that many patients who have a heart attack will have a deficiency of D3. It doesn’t mean that the deficiency caused the heart attack, but it increased the risk of heart attack,” said Tadeusz Malinski, a graduate student at Ohio University. The team, in a paper published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine, used nanosensors, which are about 1,000 times smaller in diameter than a human hair, to track the impact of Vitamin D3 on single endothelial cells — a vital regulatory component of the cardiovascular system.The dysfunction of endothelium is a common denominator of several cardiovascular diseases, particularly those associated with ischemic events, the researchers said.“There are not many, if any, known systems which can be used to restore cardiovascular endothelial cells which are already damaged, and Vitamin D3 can do it,” Malinski said. “This is a very inexpensive solution to repair the cardiovascular system. We don’t have to develop a new drug. We already have it.”Vitamin D3 may also be of clinical importance in the restoration of dysfunctional cardiac endothelium after a heart attack, capillary endothelium after brain ischemia (stroke), hypovolemia, vasculopathy, diabetes and atherosclerosis.

The launch ended in embarrassment with officials with officials losing contact with a string of satellites.Lifting off as scheduled earlier Thursday, the Soyuz rocket carried two Russian Earth-monitoring satellites as its primary payload and nine US and German piggyback satellites.During its mission the Fregat upper-stage rocket performed a complex sequence, forming several orbits for the delivery of the satellites, the Roscosmos space agency said.“In accordance with the flight programme, the Fregat upper-stage placed into orbit space vehicles of main and secondary payloads,” the space agency said in a statement.Both the Soyuz rocket and the upper stage “performed without a glitch,” the statement added.Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister in charge of space, said contact with Russia`s Kanopus-V earth monitoring satellites had been established.“Thank you, everyone,” the official tweeted.The second liftoff from the Vostochny cosmodrome ended in failure last November when Russian officials lost contact with a weather satellite hours after its launch.Apart from the Meteor weather satellite contact had been lost with 18 payloads from institutions and companies in Canada, the United States, Japan, Germany, Sweden and Norway.The glitch was a fresh embarrassment for the country`s once-proud space industry which has suffered a series of setbacks over recent yearsOfficials blamed the accident on a programming error.Thursday`s launch had been initially planned for last December but was postponed due to the November accident.In late December, Russia lost contact with Angola`s first national telecoms satellite launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan but several days later officials said they had restored communication.The inaugural launch from Vostochny spaceport took place in April 2016, with President Vladimir Putin overseeing the takeoff.It represented a major development for the country`s space sector, with the new cosmodrome touted to mark a rebirth of the industry.', 'Suzuki has launched the 2018 version of the Suzuki Hayabusa in India at Rs 13.88 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).

Thanks to the dominant show of these two batsmen, India chased South Africa 269/8 comfortably with 27 balls to go. India had no difficulty whatsoever in their chase even though they lost Rohit Sharma (20) and Shikhar Dhawan (35) fairly cheaply on what was a batting-friendly surface. Earlier in the day, South Africa captain Faf du Plessis won the toss and decided to have a bat. South Africa kept losing wickets at regular intervals and if was not for du Plessis’ 120, their challenge would have been far weaker. Du Plessis got good support from Chris Morris (37) and Andile Phehlukwayo (27*). The 74- and 56–run stands for the sixth and seventh wickets gave the Proteas a fighting total. India played two spinners in this match – Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal – and both gave a good account of themselves, returning 3/34 and 2/45 respectively.  In their chase, India were in command right from the word go, however, Sharma and Dhawan’s wickets pegged them back a little briefly. If fans had any doubts as regards India’s chances, Kohli and Rahane dissipated those with a record third-wicket 189-run stand against the Proteas to lead the tourists to their first-ever win in Durban. Both batted with great control and the South African bowlers looked completely hopeless against them. Rahane (79, 24th fifty) and Kohli (112, 33rd ton) fell towards the end of the chase but it was only a formality for the visitors from there. Hardik Pandya (3) and MS Dhoni (4) closed out the match for India. Player-of-the-Match Kohli was pleased as punch in the post-match presentation. “It was quite special. First match of the series is important. We wanted to take the momentum of the Test win [at Johannesburg] into this and when we restricted South Africa to 269 on this sort of a pitch, we were happy. Very happy for Jinx [Ajinkya Rahane]. Jinx is a top-class player. We understood fast bowling was going to be a big factor on this tour. He was superb, he took on the fast bowlers,” he said.The second match of the series will be played on Sunday at SuperSport Park in Centurion.

The Assam boxer is a regular in the national camp and had claimed a gold medal at the 2015 Nation’s Cup in Serbia.She hails from a small village in Kokrajhar where several families were displaced during the 2012 riots. Her family was among those displaced by the violence but has since moved on.Another Assam boxer, Lovlina Borgohain claimed the welterweight (69kg) gold among women, getting the better of compatriot Pooja.L Sarita Devi (60kg) settled for a silver medal after losing to Finland’s Olympic bronze-medallist Mira Potkenon.Sarita gave her all in the bout but lost on a 2-3 decision after Potkenon salvaged a rather rusty performance with a final-round flourish.In the men’s draw, Sanjeet (91kg) picked up India’s first gold of the day when he upstaged Uzbekistan’s Sanjar Tursunov.The Indian matched Tursunov punch for punch in an engrossing contest before getting a split 3-2 verdict in his favour.National champion Manish Kaushik (60kg), who stunned world and Asian medallist Shiva Thapa yesterday, didn’t have to step inside the ring to collect his gold.Manish was given a walkover by his Mongolian rival Battumur Misheelt, who pulled out owing to a cut sustained on his forehead during his semifinal bout.Asian Games bronze-medallist Satish Kumar (+91kg), however, settled for a silver, outwitted by Uzbekistan’s Bakhodir Jalolov in a split 4-1 decision.Dinesh Dagar took the welterweight (69kg) silver after going down to Uzbekistan’s Bobo-Usmon Baturov. In perhaps the most entertaining bout of the day, the Uzbek turned on the style against the gritty Indian.With a smile on his face throughout and a mostly non- existent guard, Baturov was every bit a showman as he craftily got the better of Dinesh in a unanimous verdict.To his credit, Dinesh connected a few lusty jabs of his own but Baturov was never really troubled.Later, Devanshu Jaiswal (81kg) was up against Cuba’s David Gutierrez.Although the crowd favourite gave a good account of himself in defensive tactics, the Cuban connected enough with his jabs to score a split 4-1 victory.Former world silver medallist Saweety Boora (75kg) also had to be content with a second-place finish against Cameroon’s Essaine Clotilde.', 'New Delhi: The sports ministry on Thursday received a hike of Rs 258.2 crore in the union budget for 2018-19, presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley in the Parliament here.Jaitley allocated a total of Rs 2196.36 crore for the sports ministry, compared to 1938.16 crore earmarked last year.However, one distinct feature of this year’s sports budget is the reduced funding allocated to the Sports Authority of India (SAI).SAI had received Rs 495.73 crore in the 2017-18 financial year 2017-18, but this year the allocation has been reduced to Rs 429.56 crore, a cut of Rs 66.17 crore.The category which received the maximum financial assistance is the government’s pet project ‘Khelo India’, which has received Rs 520.09 crore from the Rs 350 crore that it got last year.In fact ‘Khelo India’ constitutes 23.67 percent of the total sports budget this year.The Khelo India is one of the subsidiary part of the composite Khelo India — National Programme for Development of Sports — under which a total of Rs 1262.79 crore has been earmarked, a sharp increase from Rs 1047.19 provided last year.The budgetary assistance for the enhancement of sports facility in Jammu and Kashmir has been reduced to Rs 50 crore from previous financial year’s Rs 75 crore.While there is no specific mention of budgetary assistance for athletes, who are preparing for the upcoming Commonwealth and Asian Games, the finance minister announced an increase of nearly Rs 40 crore for the various National Sports Federations (NSFs).In the previous year (2017-18), NSFs received a total of Rs 302.18 crore. This year, it has been increased to Rs 342 crore — an increase of  Rs 41.82 crore.The National Sports Development Fund’s (NSDF) allocation remained static at Rs 2 crore while contribution to World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) remains at Rs 1 crore.The allocation for incentives to sportspersons has been increased from Rs 18.13 crore (2017-18)to Rs 23 crore for the year 2018-19.The scheme of Human Resource Development in Sports saw a cut by 50 percent from Rs 10 crore to Rs 5 crore.

French health authorities have said 36 of the 38 cases last year were clearly linked to Lactalis milk, as well as one in Spain and a suspected one in Greece. A group representing victims` families say at least 10 more cases are unaccounted for.Besnier said Lactalis was permanently closing one of its facilities at the Craon plant due to the outbreak. He also questioned the effectiveness of 16,000 tests performed by an unidentified private laboratory last year that had revealed nothing. “If the analysis of end-products had revealed the presence of Salmonella Agona, we would of course not have marketed the products and we would have avoided the crisis,” Lactalis said in a statement, referring to the laboratory tests.The victims` association said it had read Besnier`s comments with “dismay”.“These are several hundred million boxes concerned and several hundred thousand tonnes of products sent to more than 80 countries. This is a health scandal of unprecedented scale,” it said in a statement.“This implies that the victims could have been much more numerous.”Besnier said the scandal was “the biggest crisis I`ve ever had to face as a boss.”“We can`t say definitively but (the cost) will be very high, several hundred million euros,” he told Les Echos.“This case could cost us our export licence for a still undetermined period,” he added.Besnier did not give details of what the costs would be.He said a lot of the milk recalled since early December had been consumed and that returns were likely to amount to less than half of total volumes.French supermarket chains Leclerc, Auchan, Carrefour and Systeme U have all acknowledged that some of the baby milk remained on their shelves after the recall.The victims` association`s lawyer said families intended to file lawsuits against Auchan and Leclerc. Besnier said Lactalis was the target of multiple legal complaints.', 'MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) is witnessing protests and demands for freedom from Islamabad’s vice-grip. A day-long seminar attended by over 2,000 people in Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK, saw repeated calls against the way Islamabad governs the region and demands for the shutting down of the terrorist camps spread across the region.The seminar was organised by the United Kashmir People’s National Party (UKPNP) on Wednesday, to commemorate the Tariq Mehmood Shaheed Peace Foundation.Leaders who spoke at the event demanded the restoration of self-governance to Kashmiris. They also called on people from across the political spectrum in PoK to join hands to combat extremism and the large number of terrorist training and staging camps spread across PoK and Gilgit-Baltistan.The UKPNP’s student wing, the United Kashmir National Students Organisation (UKNSO), staged a demonstration. Its members raised slogans demanding freedom, and the recall of the Lent Officers – four high-ranking officials appointed by Islamabad who control all authority in the region.UKPNP leaders also raised objection to the exploitation of the land and resources of PoK and Gilgit-Baltistan. But most worryingly for Pakistan, their objection specifically mentioned ‘mega projects’ in the disputed area – a shot that implicates the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), without directly mentioning it.Not just CPEC, a number of other projects that are the result of the China-Pakistan ‘all-weather’ friendship have been constructed in Gilgit-Baltistan. As the only land under Pakistani control that borders China, the Karakoram Highway (KKH), passes through Gilgit-Baltistan. The 30-year old KKH project is now seen as a critical part of CPEC.Pakistan also proposes to build a massive hydroelectric power project in PoK, called the Diamer-Bhasha Dam. This is the same project that Pakistan had refused to bring under CPEC after China asked for the right to own and operate it.The PoK leaders pointed out that all these projects are clear violations of United Nations resolutions on Kashmir, as well as international laws.UKPNP leaders also expressed anger and concern over the effects of terrorism, radicalisation and intolerance on local populations in PoK “in the name of jihad”. They accused Pakistan’s intelligence agencies for trapping poor Kashmiri youth in a cycle of terrorism.They also said PoK is the site of regular human rights violations, especially in the form of the enforced disappearances of people who live in villages along close to the Line of Control. UKPNP also urged Pakistan to withdraw all fabricated sedition charges against peaceful Kashmiri nationalists like Baba Jan, Iftikhar Hussain and their colleagues. Pakistan tried these under anti-terrorism laws and sent them to prison for 40 years. UKPNP demanded their immediate and unconditional release.', 'In a shocking incident, a 19-year-old girl was allegedly raped inside a cinema hall in Hyderabad on Monday last.

Several sections of the society, including farmers, are angry with the Raje government, claimed party members in a letter to BJP chief Amit Shah. “The people of the state are not happy with Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje’s style of functioning. The party workers are losing confidence due to her working style,” wrote Ashok Choudhary, head of the BJP’s Kota district OBC wing.Rajasthan is heading for state Assembly polls later this year.On February 1, the BJP government lost the by-polls to Lok Sabha seats of Ajmer and Alwar and Mandalgarh Assembly seat. Defeating BJP’s Shakti Singh Hada, Congress candidate Vivek Dhakar won Mandalgarh Assembly seat. In Ajmer, Congress candidate Raghu Sharma defeated BJP’s Ramswaroop Lamba, while in Alwar, Congress leader Dr Karan Singh Yadav defeated the BJP’s Jaswant Yadav.On February 2, the very next day, Choudhary wrote the letter to Shah.Terming state president Ashok Parnami as a “slave of Raje”, Choudhary said he was continuously causing damage to the organisation.He further added that Raje had fallen into the “trap” of bureaucracy (IAS, IPS, RAS, RPS) and that her present actions can only lead to the party’s defeat in the state.Requesting the party high command to change the party leadership in the state, Choudhary claimed that new leadership will infuse energy into the organisation ahead of the Assembly polls.Kota is known as a BJP bastion. The saffron party had lost in only one of the 17 seats in the district in the 2013 state Assembly polls.When contacted, Choudhary admitted that he had written the letter to Shah.Maintaining that he had put forward the plight of the workers to the party’s national head, he said, “Each and every word in the letter is that of the party workers.”Bundi district BJP spokesperson Sanjay Lathi echoed the views expressed by Choudhary and admitted that there was a deep unrest among the party workers against the state leadership.He suggested that the government and the party jointly probed the reasons of its bypoll defeat and worked towards gaining the lost confidence and energy of the party workers. ', 'Jodhpur: In a major relief to filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who has been facing opposition from the Rajput community for his period film “Padmaavat”, the Rajasthan High Court today quashed an FIR against him and two lead actors of the film, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.Justice Sandeep Mehta, while ordering to quash the FIR against the three, said the film depicted the glory of Rajput queen Padmini and that there was nothing in it, which could be described as distortion of historical facts and which could hurt the sentiments of a particular community, as alleged in the complaint.In his order, Justice Mehta said the film depicted the glorious history of Rajasthan. Citing the Supreme Court order, allowing the film to be released, the judge said the Rajasthan government should ensure adequate security arrangements in the state for its release.Bhansali’s lawyer Nishant Bora said earlier, the court had refused to pass any order on Bhansali’s plea to quash the FIR, before watching the film.Yesterday, a special screening was organised for Justice Mehta at a multiplex here.There was a heavy police deployment on the court premises today in view of the decision on Bhansali’s plea. ', 'The world’s most powerful rocket, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, blasted off Tuesday on its highly anticipated maiden test flight, carrying CEO Elon Musk’s cherry red Tesla roadster toward an orbit near Mars. Screams and cheers erupted at Cape Canaveral, Florida as the massive rocket fired its 27 engines and rumbled into the blue sky over the same NASA launchpad that served as a base for the US missions to Moon four decades ago.“Wow, did you guys see that? That was awesome,” said SpaceX commentator Lauren Lyons as applause thundered through mission control. SpaceX commentator John Innsbrucker said it was “everything you could want in a test flight.”Loaded with Musk’s red Tesla and a mannequin in a spacesuit, the monster rocket’s historic test voyage has captured the world’s imagination.SpaceX’s webcast showed Musk’s Tesla roadster soaring into space, as David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” played in the background — with the words “DON’T PANIC” visible on the dashboard, in an apparent nod to the sci-fi series the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”Musk posted a video of the car on Twitter after launch, in which he can be heard laughing in the background as a camera behind the mannequin’s head shows the car apparently in orbit around Earth. “It actually really doesn’t look real, it’s crazy,” Musk can be heard saying.He later posted another video showing a “live view of Starman” appearing to cruise, its gloved hand on the wheel, through the darkness of space, the Earth’s image reflected on its glossy red surface.The car was also outfitted with a high-data storage unit containing Isaac Asimov’s science fiction book series, the Foundation Trilogy, and a plaque bearing the names of 6,000 SpaceX employees.About two minutes into the flight, the two side boosters peeled away from the center core and made their way back toward Earth for an upright landing.Both rockets landed side by side in unison on launchpads, live video images showed.“New Olympic sport – Synchronized Landings!” wrote NASA astronaut Randy Bresnik on Twitter. “HUGE congrats to the @SpaceX team on your maiden flight! Another giant step towards making spaceflight for everyone a reality.”The third, center booster was to attempt a landing on an ocean platform although its status was still unclear.Experts said the launch would likely catch the eye of the US space agency NASA, which may consider using the Falcon Heavy as a way to fast-track its plans to reach the Moon again for the first time since 1972. Acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot congratulated SpaceX and called it a “tremendous accomplishment.”Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana said, “the successful launch of a new vehicle on its first flight is a significant accomplishment they can be very proud of.”Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield tweeted: “What we’re watching is @SpaceX leaving all other rocket companies in the dust. Congrats to everyone there!”The Falcon Heavy launched from the same NASA pad that was the base for the Apollo-era Moon missions of the 1960s and 1970s.It is “the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two,” SpaceX said.That means it can carry twice the payload of United Launch Alliance’s Delta IV Heavy, at a far lower cost — about $90 million per launch compared to $350 million for its competitor. But the Falcon Heavy is not the most powerful rocket ever — just the biggest in operation today.The Saturn V rocket that propelled astronauts to the Moon could deliver more payload to orbit. The Soviet-era Energia, which flew twice in 1987 and 1988, was also more powerful.The Falcon Heavy is essentially three smaller, Falcon 9 rockets strapped together, adding up to a total of 27 engines.The 230-foot (70-meter) tall rocket is designed to carry nearly 141,000 pounds (64 metric tonnes) into orbit — more than the mass of a fully loaded 737 jetliner.It was initially designed to restore the possibility of sending humans to the Moon or Mars, but those plans have shifted and now the Falcon Heavy is being considered mainly as a potential equipment carrier to these deep space destinations, Musk said Monday.Instead, another rocket and spaceship combination being developed by SpaceX, nicknamed BFR — alternately known as “Big Fucking Rocket,” or “Big Falcon Rocket” — would be the vehicle eventually certified for travellers.', 'Washington: In another major blow to Islamabad, a bill seeking to end all economic aid to Pakistan was moved by the United States on Tuesday. The development comes a month after the Trump administration suspended it’s $255-billion military aid to the country.Unhappy with Pakistan’s approach to terrorists on home soil, the US House of Representatives joined the Senate on Tuesday to end the US economic aid, reported Pakistan’s national daily Dawn. “The legislation, introduced by Congressmen Mark Sanford from South Carolina and Thomas Massie from Kentucky, seeks to prohibit the US State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) from sending American taxpayer money to Pakistan,” said the report. “When the American people support other nations, our generosity shouldn’t be used to reward terrorists with US taxpayer dollars,” Congressman Sanford said. The money set aside for the purpose should be invested in infrastructure projects in the US, he added. Armed with proofs, India has repeatedly pointed at Pakistan’s trangressions and how it creates instability in the region by providing military aid and intelligence to terrorists. Meanwhile, a top Trump administration official once asked Pakistan to expel terrorists, especially the Taliban leaders, operating from terror safe havens within its soil.“We’ve had a number of discussions with our Pakistani partners on expectations for change and expelling terrorists from areas in which they’ve been allowed to operate,” Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a Congressional hearing on Afghanistan on Tuesday.“They (Pakistan) understand what we expect…Our suspension of security assistance continues until we see more evidence that they are in fact taking action,” Sullivan said.He said the US has been in discussions with Pakistan but there has been not a “sufficient amount of action” from it against terrorists.', 'New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is all set to announce its bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement on Wednesday amid presumptions that the central bank will continue with pause on key interest rate in view of firming inflation.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, started its 2-day meeting yesterday. The outcome of the 6-member MPC meeting is being keenly awaited by stakeholders amidst a huge sell-off in the stock markets globally.In its December review, the MPC had kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged on concerns of a possible price rise but had left the door ajar for a rate cut in future.Retail inflation crossed the RBI’s comfort level and rose to 5.21 per cent in December on increase in prices of food items. The retail inflation, based on Consumer Price Index CPI), was 4.88 per cent in November. In December 2015, it was 3.41 per cent.The Reserve Bank of India had reduced the benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6 per cent in August, bringing it to a 6-year low.Bankers and experts are of the view that for the third time in a row, RBI may key repo-rate or short term lending rate unchanged as inflation trajectory is likely to remain upward at a time when crude oil prices in international market has started firming up and government plans to raise crop support price.Also, pick up in economic activity in the second half of the current financial year, ending March 31, will reduce pressure on RBI to go in for a rate cut to boost growth.Experts said that while the main concern for the central bank will be the rising inflation trajectory, the MPC will also factor in the Union Budget 2018-19 presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to Parliament earlier this month.RBI has been asked by the government to target inflation at 4 per cent, plus or minus 2 per cent, and its rise beyond the comfort zone will put pressure on the central bank not cut interest rate (repo rate).After the government presented the pre-budget Economic Survey to Parliament, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian too had indicated that the scope for RBI to lower interest rate may be limited with growth picking up and inflation hardening.With PTI Inputs', 'PATNA: While the Bihar administration had been claiming that it is well prepared for the state board exams, a huge lapse has come to light on the first day of the exam itself.

So naturally, the reaction of the team is that does Hichki currently have the best release date to get an extended run in cinemas across India.”He described it as an “out and out family movie that will entertain audiences across all age groups”.“The YRF team decided that 23 March, 2018 is the best release date for ‘Hichki’, especially given the post exam scenario for students and families – the most relevant target audience for this film,” Sharma added.Manan Mehta, Vice President – Marketing and Merchandising, YRF said: “With exams out of the way, March 23 gives us the opportunity to reach out to and speak to the youth, especially school students, and their families as this film is extremely relevant to them.”Rani plays Naina Mathur, who has a nervous system disorder, Tourette Syndrome that forces an individual to make involuntary repetitive movements or sounds.Directed by Siddharth P Malhotra, the film essentially is about staring down at challenges that life throws at one and ultimately winning over them, apart from being a subtle reminder about discrimination that exists in our society.It highlights this through the story of Naina, who faces discrimination from the society that firmly believes she cannot be a teacher because of her disorder.

He was arrested by Telangana CID after deportation and sent in remand. The man was reportedly involved in the Sai Baba Temple blast in Dilsukhnagar in 2002.Two persons were killed and 15 injured in the blast at the temple on November 21, 2002 evening. The police charged Muzzabir with arranging funds for the blast and other terror activities.  The CID had arrested a few other persons involved in the case, including Syed Salahuddin Salar, in 2011.

Also, the virtual currencies values have been tumbling on worries about government regulation. Bitcoin fell to its lowest since November at $5,992 in the Hong Kong market in early trade on Tuesday.According to Chandra, the I-T Department had conducted various surveys on cryptocurrency exchanges to understand how many people are regular contributors, how many had registered themselves and how many have traded on exchanges.“We found out that there is no clarity on investments made by many people which means that they have not declared it properly.“We have informed all the DGs (Director Generals of Income Tax) across India, they are issuing notices and so that would be taxed,” he added.He also said that as per income tax laws, money invested in virtual currencies would be taxable if the source is unexplained. Moreover, the profit gained on such investments is taxable.“So we will tax that particular amount and they should pay tax on that,” Chandra added.In December last, the Indian government sounded the alarm on the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies, comparing them with the notorious Ponzi schemes floated to dupe gullible investors.According to a Finance Ministry statement, which said that as virtual currencies were not backed by assets, their prices are entirely a “matter of mere speculation”.“Consumers need to be alert and extremely cautious as to avoid getting trapped in such Ponzi schemes,” it said.It clarified that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and do not have any regulatory permission or protection in India.“The Government or Reserve Bank of India has not authorised any virtual currencies as a medium of exchange. Further, the government or any other regulator in India has not given license to any agency for working as an exchange or any other kind of intermediary for any virtual currency,” the statement said.According to investigation agencies here, with the demand and price of cryptocurrencies on the rise, cybercriminals have found innovative ways to dupe those looking to invest.Bitcoins in India have been trading at more than Rs 10 lakh each, while people are investing amounts ranging from Rs 3,000 to several lakhs of rupees.Bitcoin values in New York, for instance, have soared nearly 1,600 percent over the past year and have gone upwards of $15,000.In December, cryptocurrency dealer Pluto Exchange announced the launch of India`s first mobile application for transacting in virtual currencies.', 'New Delhi: India on Tuesday said that it was disturbed by the situation in the Maldives where President Abdulla Yameen has declared a state of emergency.“We are disturbed by the declaration of a state of emergency in the Maldives following the refusal of the government to abide by the unanimous ruling of the full bench of the Supreme Court on February 1 and also by the suspension of constitutional rights of the people of Maldives,” the External Affairs Ministry said in statement.“The arrest of the Supreme Court chief justice and political figures are also reasons for concern.

Nasheed was narrowly defeated in 2013 by President Yameen. He says his conviction on terror charges was politically motivated.Meanwhile, Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and another judge, Ali Hameed, were arrested hours after Yameen declared a state of emergency on Monday. Former president Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition, was also detained at his home.In a televised address to the nation today, President Yameen accused judges of plotting to overthrow him. “I had to declare a national emergency because there was no other way to investigate these judges,” he said.“We had to find out how thick the plot or coup was,” he said, adding that the chief justice was trying to illegally impeach him and sack the attorney general.The country has seen a number of political crisis since the ouster of Nasheed in 2012.(With IANS and PTI inputs)', 'New Delhi: After the Opposition parties boycotted the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, its chairman M Venkaiah Naidu issued a letter to the members of the House.Naidu, in his letter, said it would be his commitment to allow any issue to be raised by anybody as per rules and procedures and nobody should have any misgivings about that.The letter also clarifies his decision to adjourn the House for a longer period instead of frequent adjournments. The Vice President also hinted at some sections of the House who are bent on not allowing smooth conduct of the House.The Opposition on Tuesday accused the Rajya Sabha Chair of ignoring the “rules, regulations, procedures and traditions” by not allowing its members to raise some crucial issues and by giving long adjournments.A combined Opposition on Tuesday boycotted the Rajya Sabha in the post-lunch sitting, complaining that their voice was being muzzled outside as well as inside Parliament.In the morning, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien had given a notice under Rule 267 to discuss the alleged overreach of West Bengal Governor KN Tripathi who was trying to bypass the state government in administrative matters.Naidu rejected the notice and when O’Brien persisted with the matter during the Zero Hour, adjourned the House till 2 pm, skipping even the Question Hour held from 12 noon to 1 pm on Tuesday, IANS reported.When the House met again at 2 pm, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the issue of the House being adjourned without conducting the Zero Hour and the Question Hour for the past few days, saying Parliament works according to “rules, regulations, procedures and conventions” and not “according to one’s whims”.Azad was joined by other Opposition leaders including Samajwadi Party’s Naresh Agarwal, O’Brien and Communist Party of India-Marxist’s Tapan Sen in the protest.As Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien said that Chairman’s decisions could not be questioned in the House and the aggrieved members may meet him in his chamber, Azad announced that the Opposition is boycotting the House for the day and the entire Opposition then walked out. Kurien then adjourned the House till 3 pm on Tuesday.Outside the House, Congress, Samajwadi Party, Trinamool, DMK, CPI-M, CPI and AAP leaders told the media that an attempt was being made to stifle the Opposition’s voice for “last one week or so”.Following is the full text of Naidu’s letter, as per ANI:From the day I have assumed the office of Chairman of this august House, I have made it clear that any issue sought to be raised by any member of the House, will be allowed to be raised. I have reasons to believe that no hon’ble member would have any grouse in this regard.I am deeply concerned with the negative public perception of this august House on account of forced adjournments and that too quite frequently over the years, which frequently follows a pattern. A pattern aimed at not allowing the House to function smoothly, come what may.Ever since I started chairing the proceedings of this House, leaders of several parties have conveyed their anguish to me over how they are being deprived of their right to raise issue of concern to them as some parties strategise for disruptions leading to forced adjournments. I have shared this with floor leaders on more than one occasion.Coming to the pattern of disruptions, I would like to share with honourable members that I have admitted a total of 42 zero hour admissions during the last three working days i.e, 2nd, 5th and 6th of this month. Only one could make the submission. Who is to be held responsible for denying 41 members of their right to bring their concerns to the notice of this august House and to the government.Another aspect of this pattern is that first Zero Hour is disrupted and then even question hour when the members get an opportunity to question the government is also disrupted. On many occasions over the years, house gets adjourned several times between 11 am and 1.00 pm. In this era of TV explosion, such frequent adjournments are adversely impacting the image and credibility of this House.In this backdrop, I thought that it would be better to adjourn the House for a longer period instead of resorting to frequent adjournments. That too when it becomes evident that some sections of the house were bent on not allowing smooth conduct of the House.I have discussed this concern of mine with Deputy Chairman first this morning and later with floor leaders. I have urged the leaders to ensure smooth conduct of proceedings. I also told leaders that if house proceedings were disrupted at the start, I would be left with no option but to adjourn the house till lunch.My intention in doing so is to promote a sense of collective responsibility in minimising or doing away with such forced frequent disruptions. When members and parties realise that they would ultimately be the losers of such disruptions and adjournments, they would talk to each other and enable better functioning of the house.I realise some honourable members have perhaps not properly understood my concern and anguish over the functioning of the house. I would like to reiterate again that it would be my commitment to allow any issue to be raised by anybody as per rules and procedures and nobody should have any misgivings about that. (With Agency inputs)', 'HUALIEN: Rescuers combed through the rubble of collapsed buildings on Wednesday, some using their hands as they searched for about 145 people missing after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck near the popular Taiwanese tourist city of Hualien overnight.At least four people were killed and 225 injured in the quake that hit near the coastal city just before midnight (1600 GMT) on Tuesday, officials said. The latest figures from government data indicated 145 people were missing.Many of those were believed to be still trapped inside buildings, including a military hospital, after the quake hit about 22 km (14 miles) northeast of Hualien on Taiwan`s east coast.Aftershocks with a magnitude of at least 5.0 could rock the island in the next two weeks, the government said. Japanese, Czech and mainland Chinese nationals were among the injured. Residents waited and watched anxiously as emergency workers dressed in fluorescent orange and red suits and wearing helmets searched for residents trapped in apartment blocks. Hualien is home to about 100,000 people. Its streets were buckled by the force of the quake, with around 40,000 homes left without water and around 1,900 without power.Emergency workers surrounded a damaged military hospital in the area. Windows had collapsed and the building was wedged into the ground at a 40-degree angle.Rescuers worked their way around and through the building while residents looked on from behind cordoned-off roads.“We were still open when it happened,” said Lin Ching-wen, who operates a restaurant near the military hospital.“I grabbed my wife and children and we ran out and tried to rescue people,” he said. A Reuters video showed large cracks in the road, while police and emergency services tried to help anxious people roaming the streets.President Tsai Ing-wen went to the scene of the quake early on Wednesday to help direct rescue operations. “The president has asked the cabinet and related ministries to immediately launch the `disaster mechanism` and to work at the fastest rate on disaster relief work,” Tsai`s office said in a statement.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world`s largest contract chipmaker and major Apple supplier, said initial assessments indicated no impact from the earthquake.Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China considers part of its territory, lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 struck nearby on Sunday.More than 100 were killed in a quake in southern Taiwan in 2016, and some Taiwanese remain scarred by a 7.6 magnitude quake that was felt across the island and killed more than 2,000 people in 1999.', 'Colombo/Male: Maldives’ Supreme court on Tuesday night revoked an order to release nine high-profile political prisoners, hours after former president Mohamed Nasheed sought India’s military intervention to resolve the ongoing political crisis in his country following declaration of emergency by President Abdulla Yameen and arrest of two top judges.Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and another judge, Ali Hameed, were arrested after President Yameen declared a state of emergency yesterday.In a late night development, the remaining three judges of the Supreme Court amended an order to release nine high- profile political prisoners.In a statement, the judges said they were revoking the order to release the prisoners “in light of the concerns raised by the President”.The amendment to the ruling by the Supreme Court on February 1 also omits the part that says the case against the Supreme Court judges was not received by the Judicial Services Commission (JSC).Earlier today, President Yameen accused the detained judges of plotting to overthrow him.“I had to declare a national emergency because there was no other way to investigate these judges,” Yameen said in a televised address to the nation.“We had to find out how thick the plot or coup was,” he said, adding that the chief justice was trying to illegally impeach him and sack the attorney general.Former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition, was also detained at his home.Concerned over political turmoil in Maldives, India, which is monitoring the situation very “closely”, today said it was “disturbed” on the declaration of the emergency by the Maldivian government and described as a matter of “concern” the arrests of the chief justice and political figures there.“We are disturbed by the declaration of a State of Emergency in the Maldives following the refusal of the government to abide by the unanimous ruling of the full bench of the Supreme Court on February 1, and also by the suspension of constitutional rights of the people of Maldives,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement in New Delhi.“The arrest of the Supreme Court Chief Justice and political figures are also reasons for concern,” it added.India yesterday asked its nationals not to undertake non- essential travels to the island nation until further notice.Nasheed, whose Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) functions from Colombo, appealed for India’s help.“We would like the Indian government to send an envoy, backed by its military, to free the judges and the political detainees, including former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, from their detention and to bring them to their homes. We are asking for a physical presence,” Nasheed said in his tweet.The picturesque Indian Ocean archipelago, which has seen a number of political crisis since the ouster of its first democratically-elected president Nasheed in 2012, plunged into a political chaos on Thursday when the apex court ordered the release of nine imprisoned opposition politicians, maintaining that their trials were “politically motivated and flawed”.The nine political leaders included Nasheed.The Yameen government refused to implement the ruling, prompting a wave of protests in Maldives capital, Male.Nasheed said Yameen has illegally declared martial law.“President Yameen’s announcement ? which declares a state of emergency, the banning of fundamental freedoms, and the suspension of the Supreme Court? is tantamount to a declaration of martial law in the Maldives. This declaration is unconstitutional and illegal. Nobody in the Maldives is required to, nor should, follow this unlawful order,” he said.“We must remove him from power. The people of the Maldives have a legitimate request to world governments, especially to India and the United States”, said Nasheed, who is currently in Sri Lanka.He also asked the US to ensure that all American financial institutions stop all transactions of the Yameen regime’s leaders.Meanwhile, Jumhooree Party Leader Qasim Ibrahim’s son Ibrahim Siyaad Qasim has been arrested. He is the Managing Director of Villa Shipping and Trade, the Maldives largest private conglomerate company.Reacting to these developments, the US today said it was “troubled” and “disappointed” by the declaration of a state of emergency by Yameen and asked him to comply with the rule of law and implement the Supreme Court ruling.“The US calls on President Yameen, the army, and police to comply with the rule of law, implement the Supreme Court ruling and the rulings of the criminal court, ensure the full and proper functioning of the Parliament, and restore constitutionally guaranteed rights of the people and institutions of the Maldives,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in Washington.Earlier, Nasheed also expressed concern over Yameen’s deliberate delay in implementing the Supreme Court ruling to immediately release political prisoners.“This deliberate refusal by the government to uphold the Constitution further destabilises the Maldives and wider Indian Ocean security,” Nasheed said.Nasheed, 50, the country’s first democratically-elected leader — was sentenced to 13 years in jail on terror charges in March 2015 over the arbitrary arrest of chief criminal judge Abdullah Muhammed during his presidency.He was granted asylum in the UK after he was authorised to seek medical treatment there amid mounting foreign pressure.Nasheed was narrowly defeated in 2013 by President Yameen. Nasheed says his conviction on terror charges was politically motivated.The Maldivian government holds that Nasheed is convicted for a crime and is wanted in the Maldives to serve a jail sentence. Nasheed said he will seek UN support to ensure he is allowed to contest this year’s election.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Maldives reportedly said there were no safety issues for foreign nationals working in the country or tourists after India and China issued travel advisory for their nationals. ', 'SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday admitted that the number of local Kashmiri youngsters joining terrorism is steadily going up. In a written reply in the state assembly, she said that 126 local men joined terrorism in 2017. “The number of youth who joined militancy in 2017 is 126, while in 2016 the number was 88 and in 2015, it was 66,” she stated.Mehbooba had earlier vowed to break the “vicious cycle” of youth taking up arms on the death of a terrorist in the Valley. She had also said that her government is making efforts to ensure that those joining terrorist ranks return home.In her reply to the motion of thanks on the Governor’s address in the state Assembly in Jammu in January this year, she had said that Jaish-e-Mohammad’s “Afzal Guru squad” that has claimed responsibility for major terror attacks in the Valley “is a challenge for not only the government but for all of us”.As one of the steps to tackle home-grown terrorism, Mehbooba had also stated that her government had announced an amnesty to stone-pelters by withdrawing FIRs registered against them. “About 8,000 to 9,000 youth, I don’t have the exact figures, will be benefited by the withdrawal of FIRs. We have started the process in 2016 but had to stop it due to the unrest (triggered by the killing of Burhan Wani),” she had said.', 'Washington DC: Scientists have discovered massive reserves of mercury hidden in permafrost.Permafrost is a thick subsurface layer of soil that remains below freezing point throughout the year, occurring chiefly in polar regions.Researchers have discovered permafrost in the northern hemisphere stores massive amounts of natural mercury, a finding with significant implications for human health and ecosystems worldwide as exposure to mercury – even small amounts – can cause serious health problems.The study reveals the northern permafrost soils are the largest reservoir of mercury on the planet, storing nearly twice as much mercury as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined.In a new study, scientists measured mercury concentrations in permafrost cores from Alaska and estimated how much mercury has been trapped in permafrost north of the equator since the last Ice Age.“This discovery is a game-changer,” said Paul Schuster, a hydrologist at the U. S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado and lead author of the new study. “We’ve quantified a pool of mercury that had not been done previously, and the results have profound implications for better understanding the global mercury cycle.”Warmer air temperatures due to climate change could thaw much of the existing permafrost layer in the northern hemisphere. This thawing permafrost could release a large amount of mercury that could potentially affect ecosystems around the world. Mercury accumulates in aquatic and terrestrial food chains and has harmful neurological and reproductive effects on animals.“There would be no environmental problem if everything remained frozen, but we know the Earth is getting warmer,” Schuster said. “Although measurement of the rate of permafrost thaw was not part of this study, the thawing permafrost provides a potential for mercury to be released–that’s just physics.”The new findings have major implications for understanding how Earth stores mercury and for human and environmental health, according to James Shanley, a research hydrologist at the U. S. Geological Survey in Montpelier, Vermont, who was not involved with the new research.“This study is very novel and makes a big discovery in an area that was previously somewhat ignored,” Shanley said. “It shows permafrost represents a huge source of mercury, and if it thaws due to climate change the mercury could be released and could significantly add to the global mercury burden.”Natural mercury found in the atmosphere binds with organic material in the soil, gets buried by sediment, and becomes frozen into permafrost, where it remains trapped for thousands of years unless liberated by changes such as permafrost thaw.Schuster’s team determined the total amount of mercury locked up in permafrost using field data.Between 2004 and 2012, the study authors drilled 13 permafrost soil cores from various sites in Alaska and measured the total amounts of mercury and carbon in each core. They selected sites with a diverse array of soil characteristics to best represent permafrost found around the entire northern hemisphere.Schuster and his colleagues found their measurements were consistent with published data on mercury in non-permafrost and permafrost soils from thousands of other sites worldwide. They then used their observed values to calculate the total amount of mercury stored in permafrost in the northern hemisphere and create a map of mercury concentrations in the region.The study found approximately 793 gigagrams, or more than 15 million gallons, of mercury, is frozen in northern permafrost soil. That is roughly 10 times the amount of all human-caused mercury emissions over the last 30 years, based on emissions estimates from 2016.The study also found all frozen and unfrozen soil in northern permafrost regions contains a combined 1,656 gigagrams of mercury, making it the largest known reservoir of mercury on the planet. This pool houses nearly twice as much mercury as soils outside of the northern permafrost region, the ocean and the atmosphere combined.Scientists are still unsure how much of the stored mercury would affect ecosystems if the permafrost were to thaw. One major question revolves around how much of the mercury would leach out of the soil into surrounding waterways, according to Steve Sebestyen, a research hydrologist at the USDA Forest Service in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, who was not involved with the new research.If the mercury is transported across waterways, it could be taken up by microorganisms and transformed into methylmercury, he said. This form of mercury is a dangerous toxin that causes neurological effects in animals ranging from motor impairment to birth defects.“There’s a significant social and human health aspect to this study,” Sebestyen said. “The consequences of this mercury being released into the environment are potentially huge because mercury has health effects on organisms and can travel up the food chain, adversely affecting native and other communities.”Edda Mutter, science director for the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council, said the new study demonstrates thawing permafrost could have grave consequences for local ecosystems and indigenous communities in the northern hemisphere.“Rural communities in Alaska and other northern areas have a subsistence lifestyle, making them vulnerable to methylmercury contaminating their food supply,” Mutter said. “Food sources are important to the spiritual and cultural health of the natives, so this study has major health and economic implications for this region of the world.”The release of mercury could also have far-reaching global consequences, according to Shanley. Mercury released into the atmosphere can travel large distances and could affect communities and ecosystems thousands of miles away from the release site, he said.Schuster believes his team’s research gives policymakers and scientists new numbers to work with and calibrate their models as they begin to study this new phenomenon in more detail.“24 percent of all the soil above the equator is permafrost, and it has this huge pool of locked-up mercury,” he said. “What happens if the permafrost thaws? How far will the mercury travel up the food chain? These are big-picture questions that we need to answer.”The new study was published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.', 'The two people who hacked ride-hailing firm Uber’s data in 2016 were in Canada and Florida at the time, a company security executive told a US congressional committee.About 25 million people whose data was compromised in the breach live in the United States, Uber Technologies Inc chief information security officer John Flynn said in written testimony to a Senate Commerce Committee panel. Of those, 4.1 million were drivers, said Flynn, whose testimony described new details about the hack, the handling of which prompted newly appointed Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi to fire two top security officials.Uber disclosed the breach of 57 million worldwide users in November, about a year after it occurred. In December a 20-year-old man was primarily behind the breach, and that he was paid by Uber to destroy the data through a so-called “bug bounty” program, which is designed to reward researchers for uncovering security vulnerabilities.Flynn confirmed the man who obtained data from Uber was in Florida and revealed that his partner, who first contacted the company on November 14, 2016, to demand a six-figure payment, was in Canada.Uber’s security team made contact with both people and received “assurances” the pilfered data had been destroyed before paying them $100,000, Flynn said. Sources familiar with the breach told Reuters in December the company did a forensic analysis of the Florida hacker’s computer to verify the deletions. A Canadian Royal Canadian Mounted Police representative said she had no immediate comment on the case.Flynn said Uber had made mistakes, including paying the hackers through its “bug bounty” program. “We made a misstep in not reporting to consumers, and we made a misstep in not reporting to law enforcement,” Flynn said. Republican and Democratic lawmakers admonished Uber for its delay in disclosing the breach.”The fact that the company took approximately a year to notify impacted users raises red flags within this committee as to what systemic issues prevented such time-sensitive information from being made available to those left vulnerable,” Republican Jerry Moran said.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Uber’s management of the hack was “morally wrong and legally reprehensible,” and that the company appeared to violate state rules for data breach disclosure.Compromised data includes names, phone numbers and email addresses but not Social Security numbers or credit card information of Uber users. Driver’s license numbers of 600,000 drivers were also compromised.', 'Cape Town: India opener Shikhar Dhawan on Tuesday admitted that spinner Kuldeep Yadav was harder to read than Yuzvendra Chahal.Dhawan was speaking ahead of the third ODI against South Africa, which takes place here on Wednesday.The duo of Kuldeep and Chahal have shared 13 wickets among them from the two ODIs so far.“It is difficult to play wrist-spinners because they can turn the ball on flat tracks also. And when the ball starts turning, the overseas players especially aren’t very used to it. That can create doubts in batsmen’s minds, which is why they are effective,” Dhawan said in a pre-match press conference.“If I speak of Kuldeep and Chahal, I personally find Kuldeep harder to read, and easier to read the leg spinners. There are many who can’t read the leg spinner’s googly, so Chahal’s googly will surely fool batsmen. But speaking for myself only, I find Kuldeep tougher to read,” he added.Virat Kohli’s men will look to triple their lead in the ongoing series against the Proteas on Wednesday.

With the absence of Gambhir in the side, the captaincy spot remains vacant. Uthappa said that he is willing to take up the mantle of captaincy for the upcoming season of the IPL.Speaking to Sportstar, he said. “Of course, I am. I’ll be honored if the opportunity came along but it’s for the think-tank to decide — whatever role they want me to take, I’ll give my 110 percent. Adding value to my team as a cricketer is crucial to my game”.Uthappa, who had previously played for Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and the now-defunct Pune Warriors India, has been part of the Kolkata set-up since 2014. The opening batsman praised the Kolkata fans and team management for treating him with so much love for all these years. “The initial five or six years of the IPL, I moved around a lot, so for me to find one place I could call home was important. The people back in Kolkata are absolutely fantastic, they’ve treated me with so much love and care. Even the team management has stood by me right from the time I joined them,” the 32-year old said.India Under-19 star Shubman Gill, who won the man-of-the-series award in the recently concluded ICC Under-19 World Cup 2018 was bought by KKR for Rs 1.8 crore during players ‘auction.Speaking about the youngster, Uthappa said, “(Shubman) Gill has got a very strong game, I think he’s a naturally aggressive player. And he looks very versatile at this point in time. Obviously, the variations and pace (in IPL) are going to be different — it’ll be five or 10 clicks faster. It’s about acclimatizing to the conditions but I feel these guys will do great because of the kind of exposure they’ve had at such a young age. The next few years are going to be strong years for KKR,” he signed off.', 'Sharjah: Rising star Rashid Khan led Afghanistan to a 17-run victory over Zimbabwe in the second T20 international at Sharjah on Tuesday to wrap up a 2-0 win in the two-match series.Mohammad Nabi top-scored with a 26-ball 45 as Afghanistan finished on 158-9 from their 20 overs despite losing six wickets for 18 runs, with Zimbabwe falling short on 141-5. Nabi had also struck 40 in the opening match which saw Afghanistan win by five wickets on Monday.Zimbabwe were always behind the rate once 16-year-old spinner Mujeeb Zadran — who played a starring role in Afghanistan’s run to the Under-19 World Cup semi-finals — took two early wickets to finish with 2-21 in just his second T20 international.Leg-spinner Khan, 19, was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for $1.41 million in last month’s Indian Premier League auction and finished with 2-23.Afghan captain Asghar Stanikzai held his trump card up his sleeve on Tuesday, not introducing Rashid until the 13th over, and the youngster claimed the crucial wicket of Sikandar Raza for a 26-ball 40 as the Zimbabwe all-rounder was trapped lbw by a googly.The Africans’ last hope was Ryan Burl, but he holed out for 30 off Khan.The two teams will play a five-match one-day international series starting on February 9, with Afghanistan set to take on India in their maiden Test match at Bangalore in June.Scores in the second T20 between Afghanistan and Zimbabwe in Sharjah on Tuesday:Afghanistan 158-9 in 20 overs (Mohammad Nabi 45; Tendai Chatara 3-20) v Zimbabwe 141-5 in 20 overs (Sikandar Raza 40; Mujeeb Zadran 2-21, Rashid Khan 2-23)Result: Afghanistan win by 17 runs', 'Mumbai: His confidence bolstered after a stint with former England goalkeeper David James, India’s U-17 custodian Dheeraj Singh Moirangthem today left for a trial at Scottish Premiership club Motherwell FC.His training sting is starting from tomorrow. Dheeraj, who manned India’s post at the FIFA U-17 World Cup at home last year, quit Indian Arrows, the All India Football Federation’s developmental squad playing in the I-League, after the end of his contract on December 31, 2017. And while Arrows’ Portuguese coach Luis Norton de Matos was disappointed by his decision, a stint with James at Indian Super League (ISL) franchise Kerala Blasters has been encouraging.According to Dheeraj’s agent Anuj Kichlu, the 17-year-old goalkeeper from Manipur will train with Motherwell FC’s first time. In case he manages to impress the coaches at Motherwell FC, Dheeraj will still have to wait till July, when he turns 18, to obtain an international transfer.Motherwell’s interest in the Indian goalkeeper grew after his impressive showing at the U-17 World Cup.

Their victory is inspirational and reminds us of the limitless power of the human mind.“I am given to understand that the BCCI has lent its support to these players in the past and considering a similar initiative this time too.”It was India’s second title at the mega event as earlier they had won the 50-over World Cup, outclassing Pakistan at Cape Town, South Africa in December 2014.“However, I believe that it is time that a long-standing request to be recognised by the BCCI be considered. This gesture will truly be an acknowledgment of their passion for the sport of cricket.“You may also consider bringing these champions under the BCCI pension scheme towards their long-term financial security.”Rai had said after the triumph that the World Cup-winning players will be rewarded for their performance by the BCCI.Tendulkar said recognition for CABI could have a ripple effect.“The recognition by BCCI will go a long way in ushering a new era in Indian sports for the physically challenged where every athlete feels secure and celebrated, not struggling and eventually forgotten.“Needless to add, it will also serve as a motivation for many others to take up sports passionately.

Thurman told columnist Maureen Dowd that she’d expressed fear beforehand, and asked that a stunt driver do it instead. An irritated Tarantino convinced her to do it, she said, and she crashed into a tree, suffering what she said was permanent neck damage, a concussion and damage to her knees. Video that Thurman provided the Times — provided to her by Tarantino himself — shows her struggling to control the car before crashing, and then being lifted out of the vehicle.In an interview with Deadline published Monday, Tarantino disputed some of the details in the Times account but said he had indeed persuaded Thurman to drive the car, although not as angrily as described. He said he had driven the road himself and it had seemed totally straight, but that a decision was made for Thurman to drive it in the other direction, and somehow there was a turn that he didn’t expect.“I didn’t force her into the car,” he told Deadline. “She got into it because she trusted me. And she believed me.” He said seeing the crash was “just horrible … It was heartbreaking.” He called it “the biggest regret of my life.”', 'Mumbai: Sara Ali Khan is still working on her debut project, but she already has a plan.

Accusing the Congress of muzzling democracy in the country, the Prime Minister said that Congress did injustice to even Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.Here are 5 most hard-hitting quotes from PM Modi’s speech in Lok Sabha on Wednesday:1. Had the Congress governments in the past worked responsibly, they would have taken the country to new heights. Had they kept the right directions with right intentions, this country would have been in a much better position at present.2. I don’t know if I should call it arrogance or lack of knowledge when they say Jawaharlal Nehru brought democracy to India. There was democracy in India even during the era of Lichhvi kingdom and Gautam Buddha.3. What was the democracy that prevented Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel from becoming the Prime Minister of India despite him getting the votes? Had Sardar been our first prime minister, a part of Kashmir that is with Pakistan would have been a part of India.4. Which democracy does Congress talk about? When their prime minister Rajiv Gandhi landed in Hyderabad and a Dalit leader came to welcome him, he insulted him publicly. Is that the democracy that Congress talks about?5. Congress leader tore an ordinance brought by a Prime Minister, so they have no right to teach us about democracy. It does not suit them. How did the Congress act in Kerala, how did they treat the Akali Dal in Punjab, how did they behave in Tamil Nadu? Why did Congress dismiss so many state governments at their will?

Appearing for UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, Sibal had said that the hearing should be deferred to July 2019, suggesting that it be held after the outcome of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The lawyers had also demanded that the case be referred to a five-judge Constitution Bench.The court, however, rejected the plea by Sibal and scheduled the hearing for February 8.The top court was moved challenging the High Court verdict by petitioners M.

Magazine by Peter Economy, McDonald’s French fries may hold the secret ingredient that could be the answer to our hair fall woes.Undoubtedly, losing hair is heart-breaking and watching your hair as they lose their density is really a nightmare, but will this really help?As this ‘miracle solution’ went viral and began to garner eyeballs, the Japanese scientist by the name of professor Junji Fukuda, who managed to develop a way to grow hair follicles at a record rate, has debunked this theory.The study used two kinds of cells placed in silicone containers to cultivate “hair follicle germs” — the sources of the tiny organs that grow and sustain hair.The silicone used in his study, dimethylpolysiloxane, is reportedly used by the fast-food giant in its oil fryers, but consuming the substance alone offers no fringe benefits.The scientist said that he is baffled by how readers have misinterpreted his research. “I have seen online comments asking, ‘how many fries would I have to eat to grow my hair?'” he told AFP.“I’d feel bad if people think eating something would do that!”The Japanese research paper, published in the journal Biomaterials, had announced the discovery of a new method for the mass preparation of hair follicle germs (HFGs) that “may lead to a new treatment for hair loss.”“A key ingredient in this new method is a chemical by the name of dimethylpolysiloxane (DMPS), which just happens to be an ingredient in the oil that McDonald’s uses to cook its French fries and other fried food,” wrote Economy.He further said that the paper opens up the possibility for the fast food company to “put it front and centre in its marketing.”But, with this clarification, Fukuda hopes to put the theory to rest.\", 'New York: Drinking tea when it is too hot may increase the risk of esophageal cancer in those who smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol daily, a new study warns.However, tea aficionados do not have much reasons to worry as the researchers found that in the absence of both excessive alcohol consumption and smoking, daily tea drinking was not associated with esophageal cancer risk.“Drinking hot tea contributed to cancer only when it clustered with smoking and drinking alcohol excessively,” lead author Jun Lv, Professor at Peking University in Beijing was quoted as saying by CNN.Esophageal cancer kills approximately 400,000 people every year, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, cancer research arm of the World Health Organization.For the study, the researchers followed for about 10 years 456,155 participants aged 30 to 79 in China.Participants in the study who drank high-temperature tea, consumed alcohol excessively and smoked had an esophageal cancer risk more than five times greater than those who had none of those three habits, said the study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption – both of which are known to cause esophageal cancer – as well as the chemical compounds and adverse thermal effect of hot tea, considerably complicate the association between tea drinking and cancer risk, the study suggests. The researchers found a synergistic association between hot tea drinking with excessive alcohol consumption or smoking and the risk for esophageal cancer. ', 'New Delhi: Video games have definitely taken over the world as a form of entertainment, with kids and adults alike engaging in the fun.Most people also play video games as a means to vent their stress or anger and studies have also proven their efficacy as a treatment for depression.However, a new study has encouraged parents to let their kids play video games and Legos, saying that indulging in them can help children develop spatial skills critical to success in fields like science and engineering.As per scientists, gender differences in spatial skills – like the skill needed to mentally rotate objects – disappear when the impact of childhood play was taken into account.“By providing spatial training to children, and providing spatially demanding toys before schooling starts, we can give them the opportunity to develop skills important in fields like science, technology, engineering and math,” said Anne Gold, from Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in the US.The study, published in the journal Geosphere, surveyed hundreds of undergraduate students and found a huge spread in their spatial skills.Students scored between six and 75 percent correct responses on a written, spatial-knowledge test.“All of these students completed a K-12 education. If spatial skills were taught in grade school, we wouldn’t see this significant spread of skills across the university classroom,” said Gold.“Something must be happening earlier in childhood or outside of school that makes some kids better spatial thinkers,” she said.Researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder and Carleton College in Minnesota gave written tests to 345 university undergraduates.Students tackled multiple-choice questions that required them to mentally rotate obscure shapes, for example, or visualise an object’s cross section.The researchers dissected the influence of several factors on spatial skills scores, including college major, childhood play patterns, standardised test scores, number of science courses taken, and gender.They found that childhood play patterns made a huge difference.Spatial skill scores were significantly higher among students who engaged with construction-based toys, and certain video games.Overall, male students performed better than female students on the test, but the young women and men who played with construction-based toys and video games performed equally well.In other words, when researchers controlled for the impact of childhood play patterns, gender differences disappeared.', 'One of the biggest stars of the 2018 Auto Expo has to be the Kia SP Concept. That’s because not only is it the launch pad for the Kia brand in India, it also represents the first model the brand will put on sale here, come 2019.The company is already underway on its 1.1-billion-dollar factory in Andhra Pradesh, and despite a wide range of models to choose from its international range (most of which are also on display at Kia’s Auto Expo stall), the production version of the SP Concept SUV is what will roll off the production line and into showrooms first.This is a far more rigid and square-edged take on Kia’s design language, perhaps deliberately, as usually even the SUVs have softer edges and curved surfaces. However, take a step back, and the Kia family resemblance is clear, starting with the ‘Tiger Nose’ grille at the front. This is a staple of every Kia model currently on sale. The slim headlamps are reminiscent of the Kia Optima, but from them extend a set of large fog lamp units. The clamshell bonnet has a pair of subtle ridges and the sides of the car are pleasingly devoid of drama. There are, of course, oversized wheels – this is a concept car, after all.The tail does have some chrome at the base and across the tailgate, but it’s the tail-lamps that are very familiar. They look quite similar to those on the Hyundai Creta and that’s interesting, because that will be this car’s chief rival in production form. Kia is also Hyundai’s sister company, so the possibility of platform commonalities isn’t unlikely either.Still, we’ll have to wait for the production version to show its true face, and mechanical setup, before we draw any more conclusions, but until then, we can look at this concept as a statement of Kia’s commitment to India. It was designed specifically with our market in mind, after all.', 'While spy shots of the updated i20 at Hyundai’s stockyard had already surfaced on the web, the car has got its official reveal at Auto Expo 2018. Prices for the i20 facelift start at Rs 5.34 lakh, and the mid-life update brings a fairly extensive change in terms of appearance. Its two-part grille has been replaced with a single-piece ‘Cascade’ grille similar to the one seen on the Verna and Elantra. As for other cosmetic changes, the refreshed i20 features restyled bumpers, projector headlamps with chrome inserts, and a new design for the alloy wheels. The rear end is quite different to the outgoing car, with the registration plate housing being repositioned from the bumper to the boot lid.On the inside, the updated i20 gets minor tweaks. The most noticeable change is the shift to a more advanced 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality. Hyundai is also offering its Auto-Link software that transmits key vehicle information straight to a linked mobile phone. Engine options have been carried over and the refreshed i20 continues with the 1.2-litre, 83hp petrol and the 1.4-litre, 90hp diesel units. And while the choice of manual transmissions stays the same (five-speed on the petrol and six-speed on the diesel), the big news is the arrival of a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) that is mated to the 1.2-litre Kappa engine. This, in effect, replaces the 1.4-litre petrol variant that was mated to a four-speed torque converter and made for the European market. It was introduced in India in September 2016 but never caught on because of its lofty pricing. Hyundai will launch the 1.2 CVT i20 in May this year. As India is a key market for Hyundai, and expecting a 7-8 percent rise in the demand for automatics in 2018, Hyundai has invested in a new transmission tailored specifically for the country. With the smaller 1.2-litre petrol engine, the i20 gets the benefit of the lower ‘small car’ tax rate (12.5 percent) which applies to cars under four metres in length, with petrol engines under 1,200cc. The 1.4-litre i20 attracted a much higher duty of 24 percent. This massive tax saving allows Hyundai to price the i20 automatic more competitively and take the Baleno CVT and Honda Jazz CVT head-on. The new CVT will also make the i20 facelift more fuel efficient, but unfortunately, there are no paddleshifters on offer.Variant-wise prices (ex-showroom, Delhi)\\nPetrol\\tDiesel\\nEra\\tRs 5.34 lakh\\tRs 6.73 lakh\\nMagna Era\\tRs 6.00 lakh\\tRs 7.31 lakh\\nSports\\tRs 6.59 lakh\\tRs 7.83 lakh\\nAsta\\tRs 7.12 lakh\\tRs 8.36 lakh\\nAsta (O)\\tRs 7.91 lkakh\\tRs 9.16 lakh', 'Apple has seen “strong demand” for replacement iPhone batteries and may offer rebates for consumers who paid full price for new batteries, the company said in a letter to US lawmakers made public.Apple confirmed in December that software to deal with ageing batteries in iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE models could slow down performance. The company apologised and lowered the price of battery replacements for affected models from $79 to $29. In the letter released to US lawmakers, amid nagging allegations that it slowed down phones with older batteries as a way to push people into buying new phones, the company said it was considering issuing rebates to consumers who paid full price for replacement batteries.The letter, released by the US Senate Commerce Committee, also said Apple provided a phone-slowing software update in January 2017 but did not disclose it until a month later. In the letter, Apple said it had known about battery problems caused by a manufacturing defect as early as fall 2016.Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the committee, said in a statement that “consumers rely on clear and transparent disclosures from manufacturers to understand why their device may experience performance changes.”Thune said that in discussions with the committee “Apple has acknowledged that its initial disclosures came up short. Apple has also promised the committee some follow-up information, including an answer about additional steps it may take to address customers who purchased a new battery at full price.”Apple did not immediately comment on Thune’s statement. The company also sent a letter in response to Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the Committee on Energy and Commerce in the US House of Representatives. Apple told the committee that it would consider extending its reduced-cost battery replacement program beyond 2018 if it can’t find a way to prevent sudden shutdowns in older iPhones without throttling processor speeds.Last week, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission said they were investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures that it slowed older iPhones with flagging batteries, Bloomberg reported.In a statement last week, Apple said it had “received questions from some government agencies” and was duly responding to them. The company had “never, and would never, do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” the statement said.Consumers so far have filed some 50 proposed class action lawsuits over Apple’s latest iPhone software update, which they allege caused unexpected shutdowns and hampered the performance of iPhone models of the SE, 6 and 7 lines.Government agencies in countries ranging from Brazil to France and Italy to South Korea are also investigating Apple following complaints.', 'Verdict: The Galaxy A8+ (2018) is Samsung’s answer to the slew of ‘flagship killers’ in the market. It shines where it matters the most for casual smartphone users in India — aesthetics, display, photography and battery. However, Samsung’s premium midranger doesn’t focus on raw performance figures like some of its rivals, thereby making it a pleasant ‘non-flagship killer,’ yet a premium smartphone in the category. When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S8 in 2017, the world was swayed by its narrow-bezel ‘Infinity Display’. Samsung’s Note 8 also got the ‘Infinity treatment’ with an even bigger display. However, rest of Samsung’s premium, as well as affordable handsets, were left alone with the conventional Samsung design language whereas other players in the affordable segments started offering bigger displays in compact form factors. To keep themselves relevant in the market, Samsung has gone for a different design approach with their 2018 lineup of their second-premium A-series and their first offering — the Galaxy A8+, aims to fight it out with the flagship killers.However, the A8+ is simply not the same old wine in a new bottle. Instead of simply stuffing older-generation hardware with an Infinity Display, Samsung has gone all out to make it a compelling choice for premium mid-range smartphone seekers with a dual front camera and refreshed innards. Samsung feels that an asking price of Rs 32,990 for the A8+ is enough to draw the crowd from the OnePlus and Honor court. Therefore, is the Galaxy A8+ really a good alternative from the conventional affordable flagships of 2018? Read on.Design, Build:The Galaxy A8+ (2018) is a smartphone that focuses on a premium user experience. One can feel this focus on ‘premiumness’ as soon as the phone is held. As we stated in our hands-on article earlier, the Galaxy A8+ looks ‘outright luxurious’. Samsung has gone for the familiar Note 8-like aesthetics, sans the curved edges on the front.However, the display with no curved edges highlights the side bezels, despite sporting a 2.5D curved glass. The bezels on the top and bottoms are also noticeably wider than the ones on the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8. Samsung’s signature design touches (right-side mounted speaker and an unusual volume rocker position) differentiate this premium Sammy from its ‘all-alike-all-boring’ rivals in the build department. The icing on the cake is the IP68 water and dust resistance certification, which means you can take it all out without worrying for liquid damages. The rear glass panel enhances the looks and feel of the device, but is a huge fingerprint magnet — thanks to the all-black variant that highlights the same. However, what’s new here is a repositioned fingerprint sensor — last year’s Galaxy A7 (2017) had the fingerprint sensor at the front on the home button. The A8+ goes for a new under-the-camera position, which is much easier to reach on a bigger phablet when compared to that of the S8 and Note 8.Despite that, we still ended up accidentally reaching the camera most of the time. Samsung’s solution for the fingerprints sensor placement isn’t flawless yet. At 191g, the A8+ is also noticeable heavy, making extended sessions of usage an issue. However, the A8+ is IP68 certified water and dust resistant, which means you can leave worrying about buying waterproof bags for this one. None of its rivals has this feature, making the A8+ earn more brownie points.Display:The Galaxy A8+ is primarily focused on providing a great display for its price and we are happy to report that Samsung has done a commendable job here. The 6-inch AMOLED display has a screen-to-body ratio of 75 per cent, thus making efficient utilisation of space.The AMOLED panel isn’t on par with its premium brothers when it comes to picture quality, but it manages to make the A8+ standout when compared to its rivals. You will certainly appreciate the eye-popping colours — particularly the mesmerising deep black colour, and the exceptional contrasts.Sunlight legibility is also decent. Since this is an AMOLED display, there’s a slight bluish tint when seen from wide angles, but it isn’t on the same levels like the Pixel 2 XL. On the whole, watching movies and playing games on this baby was a hoot.Specifications, Performance:When it comes to performance, the A8+ differs from its rivals vastly buy offering high-end mid-range specifications instead of flagship-class silicon inside. The A8+ is the first Samsung mid-range to help itself with their brand new Exynos 7885 octa-core chipset along with a Mali–G71 GPU. This is a 14nm chipset, which means it should be efficient in sipping power as well stand up to some moderate abuse. India gets the A8+ with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, with support for expansion up to 256GB.However, user experience on Samsung smartphones depends heavily on the extent to which the OS has been customised. Since the Galaxy S8, Samsung’s new ‘Samsung Experience 8.5’ UI has taken a new direction in terms of design and practicality for all of their smartphones. It’s still a highly bloated OS in the A8+, but manages to utilise the hardware efficiently with pleasing aesthetics, despite being constructed on Android Nougat 7.1.1. An Android Oreo-based OS would have made sense for a premium smartphone launched in 2018, but it’s Samsung and we know that their S-series flagships are the first ones to usually taste the latest Android OS. But what surprised us on this one is the timely rollout of security patches, which is a rare phenomenon for non-flagship Samsung smartphones.Right from the start, the Galaxy A8+ feels swift. It isn’t as quick as a OnePlus 5T, but we noticed no lags during our time with it. The animations are a bit slow and there’s a noticeable delay in transitioning between various menus. However, with 6GB of RAM, the A8+ doesn’t stutter — it manages to keep multiple apps and games active in the background without issues. Do note that the GPU doesn’t manage to bear graphics-intensive titles with ease, which results in lower-resolution textures despite high frame rates. The software also comes with certain special features, with one of them being the presence of Samsung’s AI-assistant Bixby. We saw Bixby trying to compete with Google Assistant on the Galaxy S8 and Note 8, and were satisfied with Samsung’s AI efforts had to offer. On the A8+, Samsung offers a stripped-down version of Bixby with no voice recognition and translation features.In fact, Bixby on the A8+ is merely a side-screen timeline that shows notifications from various apps and services. We feel that Samsung lost out on a great opportunity to bring an established AI feature to this segment. Nonetheless, it does analyse the usage patterns over the course of time and offers certain system-level customisations. Bixby’s image recognition feature is retained here and it works as intended (although you have to access it through the camera app).Another feature that made its way into our favourites list is the ‘Always-On Display’, which proved itself as nifty feature showing time, notifications and music controls. Additionally, Samsung Connect makes it easy for you to effortlessly manage all connected audio accessories — whether wired or wireless (we found switching audio output between multiple Bluetooth speakers as well as wired headphones without pausing music extremely convenient).However, Samsung also includes exclusive convenience features that its rivals don’t offer. For starters, the Samsung Pass feature allows you to make use of all the biometric sensors on board for logging in to social media account securely. The passwords are stored onboard, and encrypted, thanks to Samsung’s strong military-standard Knox protection. Then there’s Samsung Pay, which makes using credit/debit cards easier on the move. All you have to do is register your card and a simple swipe up from any screen to carry out your transactions. Also, there’s a face unlock feature like one on a OnePlus 5T or a Honor View 10. However, Samsung’s implementation of facial recognition isn’t as practical as that of OnePlus’ — it reacts slowly and works primarily in daylight.Camera:Despite its notable performance abilities, Samsung markets the A8+ as a selfie-focused camera smartphone. There’s a 16MP + 8MP dual camera at the front with an aperture of f/1.9. This setup allows you to capture great looking selfies with ample details and vibrant colours, even in low-light ambience. With the Live Focus mode enabled, it takes good-looking portrait shots with a clear distinction between the foreground and background. We wished Samsung pushed a similar dual camera setup for the rear as well. Here’s a sample of the front camera’s result in low-light, with Live Focus enabled.But that doesn’t mean the rear camera is incapable in any sense. The 16MP sensor with an aperture of f/1.7 is nearly as good as the Galaxy S8’s camera. The pictures have negligible noise in low light scenarios and manage to retain natural colours in all lighting conditions. However, the pictures don’t entertain enough details as one would expect on a smartphone of this price range. We noticed that the photos develop a strange ‘glowing effect’, which makes it good for the ‘Instagram crowd’, but hurts those looking for natural and crisp shots. The only way to reduce this glowing effect is to reduce the exposure manually. Samsung should fix the overexposure issue with a software update in the future.Battery:With a 3500mAh power resource the Galaxy A8+ delivers appreciable results considering its hardware package. With moderate texting, streaming music over Bluetooth devices, surfing YouTube, clicking photos and keeping the Always-On Display active, we managed to extract a maximum of a day’s backup. With Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging on board, one can top up the battery from 50 per cent in about 30 minutes, thus making this a no-brainer for those looking to carry a high mileage device.Conclusion:If you are looking for a premium smartphone that manages to strike a balance between design, performance, camera and battery, then the Samsung Galaxy A8+ (2018) should be on top of your list. The Galaxy Note 8-inspired looks, Samsung Pay and the dual selfie camera are the features that make it stand apart from the competition. It doesn’t manage to shine like the OnePlus 5T or the Honor View 10 when it comes to raw performance, but is the one to go if you want the best of all premium smartphone features along with Samsung’ brand legacy and Samsung’ after-sales service for a sensible price.Pros: Galaxy Note 8-inspired looks, notable selfie camera, Samsung Pay, AMOLED display and Samsung’s after-sales service.Cons: Average midrange performance and smudge-prone glass body.', 'Al-Qaeda`s global network remains “remarkably resilient,” posing more of a threat in some regions than the Islamic State group, UN sanctions monitors said in a report seen by AFP on Wednesday.The report sent to the Security Council said that Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), based in Yemen, served as a communications hub for the UN-designated terror group as a whole. “Al-Qaeda affiliates remain the dominant terror threat in some regions, such as Somalia and Yemen, a fact demonstrated by a continuous stream of attacks and foiled operations,” said the report.In West Africa and South Asia, Al-Qaeda-linked groups pose as serious a threat as IS affiliates who “currently remain unable to reach a dominant position,” it said.UN member-states however see potential for linkups between Al-Qaeda and IS groups to support each other, warning that in some regions this could be a new threat, the report said.The Islamic State lost its self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq last year but Al-Qaeda “remained remarkably resilient,” said the UN monitors.In Syria, the Al-Nusrah Front “remains one of the strongest and largest Al-Qaeda affiliates globally,” with its fighters “using threats, violence and material incentives” to absorb smaller armed groups.Al-Nusrah commands between 7,000 and 11,000 fighters, including several thousand foreigners, and has its main power base in Syria`s Idlib province.In Libya, IS remains intent on regaining a foothold following the loss of Sirte and has reinforced its presence with fighters returning from Iraq and Syria, the report said.Fighters from Boko Haram, which has expanded its reach from northern Nigeria, are maintaining small cells in Libya who could then move on to other regional countries.“Member-states assessed that there is a potential for the transfer of leaders from ISIL in Libya to other conflict zones in West Africa and the Sahel region, including Mali,” said the report. ', 'Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats sealed a deal Wednesday on a new coalition, officials close to the talks said, potentially ending four months of political standstill in Europe’s top economy.The sources told AFP the parties had ironed out their final differences and were ready to sign an agreement for Merkel`s fourth term.Public broadcaster ARD said the final disputes had centred around “ministry remits and personnel questions”. The breakthrough will come as a relief to Germany`s EU partners as the bloc faces tough negotiations on migration and Brexit. Merkel, Europe`s most experienced leader, has seen her standing at home and abroad weakened by the longest stretch of coalition-building in the country`s postwar history.But before she can be sworn in, a final hurdle looms: the hard-fought pact between her CDU/CSU bloc and the Social Democratic Party must still be approved by the SPD`s sceptical rank-and-file .The agreement for a renewed “grand coalition” comes after days of marathon talks in which negotiators from all three parties haggled over everything from foreign policy to labour issues and healthcare.Germany has been stuck in political limbo since September`s inconclusive general election saw mainstream parties bleed support to the far-right AfD, which tapped into anger over Merkel`s liberal refugee policy.Merkel, in power for over 12 years, at first tried to cobble together a novel three-way coalition with the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats, but those efforts collapsed in November.Faced with snap elections that could further boost the AfD or the prospect of heading an unstable minority government, she opted to woo back the SPD — her junior partner for two of her three terms since 2005.SPD leader Martin Schulz then abandoned his post-election vow to renew the party in opposition — a U-turn that angered many.Merkel`s fate now lies in the hands of the SPD, as Schulz has promised to give his party`s 460,000 members the final say on whether to accept the coalition pact.Observers expect the referendum to be tight, with the SPD`s left and youth wings fiercely opposed to another four years governing in Merkel`s shadow.The party`s fiery youth chief Kevin Kuehnert has led a campaign against another “GroKo”, as the grand coalition is known.The referendum will be held by postal ballot, with the result expected to be announced in early March.A green light could see a new Merkel-led government in place by the end of next month.A thumbs-down could spell disaster for Merkel and Schulz, whose political lives hang in the balance, and see the country headed for fresh elections.With so much at stake, Schulz was determined to extract as many concessions as possible from the tortuous coalition talks to win over sceptics.While details of the final agreement have yet to be released, former European Parliament chief Schulz has put a fairer Europe at the heart of his efforts, insisting that Berlin must join French President Emmanuel Macron`s push to deepen eurozone integration.In a draft version of the coalition pact seen by AFP, the parties agreed to support Macron`s reform drive and tentatively backed his idea of a eurozone investment budget.On the hot-button topic of migration, the two camps said they would aim to limit the annual intake to 180,000-220,000 people, a key CSU demand.The SPD however won assurances that family reunifications for refugees would resume in August, albeit restricted to 1,000 people a month.It was not immediately clear how the final sticking points in the negotiations were resolved, such as the SPD`s insistence on limiting short-term contracts and overhauling the two-tier healthcare system.On defence spending too, both sides remained at odds as the finish line neared with the conservatives more open than the SPD to raising military spending closer to NATO targets, as pushed for by US President Donald Trump.But the protracted haggling has left its scars, and surveys suggest both camps have much to fear from fresh elections in case of a “no” vote from SPD members.A recent Insa poll found that support for the CDU/CSU had fallen from 33 to 30.5 percent, while the SPD slipped from September`s historic low of 20.5 percent to 17 percent.The AfD meanwhile scored a record 15 percent.', 'Depending on your opinions, this could either be the most Orwellian, oppressive thing yet or it could be a symbol of technological advance making humans safer. China has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) system that will identify people with suicidal thoughts and send them a message on social media advising them to seek help.The AI was developed by researchers at the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It scans social media posts and comments on social media platforms to identify potentially suicidal users. It has already sent intervention messages to close to 20,000 such users since July 2017, China’s government-run newspapers have reported.The reports also said 4000 of these apparently suicidal individuals had responded to the message on Weibo, China’s Twitter clone. They also claimed that 8000 had responded by accessing online counselling tools.Suicide is a serious concern in China. It has even been announced as a priority of the Chinese government. And here is why. A report in 2017 from China’s Ministry of Health showed that suicide is the leading cause of death among the country’s youth.About 26 percent of the deaths in the 15 to 34 age group were suicides. A study also found that more than 20 percent of high school students had at some point made concrete plans to commit suicide. The report said the suicides are social pressures, family issues and emotional uncertainty.That young people are killing themselves is not just a social problem. For China, it is also a major economic problem. The nominally-communist country is faced with a shrinking labour force thanks to an ageing population. The percentage of the elderly in the total population is rising every year. Moves like the One Child Policy have also led to a situation that fewer young people have been available to enter the workforce to replace those who are retiring.This seemingly unstoppable demographic nightmare is exactly why China, any which way no beacon of personal liberty, is willing to go even further in its bids to keep whatever young people it has alive.The AI was developed over two years by Zhu Tingshao, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It uses language analysis to identify suicidal tendencies. But Zhu says it is the human factor that is more problematic when it comes to suicide prevention. “Many don’t know they have psychological problems, and some online psychological quizzes are often misleading. We hope this AI tool can help more Weibo users, not just suicidal ones,” he said.“Suicide hotlines and intervention centers are the most prevalent methods for suicide prevention. Yet only 20 percent of people with suicidal inclinations are willing to seek help. Therefore, web-based research is significant,” Zhu told Chinese government news agency Xinhua.', 'TOKYO : US Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that Washington would soon announce new, tough sanctions to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes, calling it the planet`s “most tyrannical and oppressive regime”.Speaking in Tokyo on his way to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Pence promised the United States and its allies, including Japan, would keep maximum pressure on Pyongyang until it took steps toward “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation”.“To that end, I`m announcing today the United States of America will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever. And we will continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile program once and for all,” Pence said after meeting with Japan`s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Following talks that showcased the U.S.-Japan security alliance, Abe said the two had agreed they could “never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.\\nPence reiterated Washington`s stance that “all options are on the table” to deal with North Korea.Pence`s trip to South Korea from Thursday will coincide with a visit to the Games by North Korea`s ceremonial leader, Kim Yong Nam, the most senior North Korean official to enter the South since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce.Pence had stopped short of ruling out the prospect of meeting senior North Korean officials but President Donald Trump has cast doubt on U.S. negotiations with Pyongyang any time soon. The WhiteHouse has also cautioned against reading too much into remarks Pence made en route to Japan.Pence warned against allowing North Korea, which has sent a team to the Games, to use the Olympics for propaganda.“We will not allow North Korea to hide behind the Olympic banner the reality that they enslave their people and threaten the wider region,” he said. For Friday`s opening ceremony, Pence is bringing as his guest the father of Otto Warmbier, an American student who died\\nin June last year after being imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months. North Korea test-fired ballistic missiles over Japan last year, as well as a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that climbed to an altitude of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles) before splashing into the sea within Japan`s exclusive economic zone.Concern about North Korea is pushing Japan to update its missile defence. Besides extending the range and increasing the accuracy of its Patriot system, it will add two U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors and plans to add to its arsenal air-fired cruise missiles that can strike North Korean missile sites.Earlier, Pence visited a Japanese Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, Japan`s last line of defence against any possible North Korean missile strike.Although trade friction is taking a backseat to security during his visit, Pence is also set to meet Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier and is Pence`s counterpart in economic talks.Pence said that Washington wanted to promote growth based on “free and fair” trade but added that regional security issues were his main reason for coming to Japan.

You divided India. Even after 70 years of Independence, 125 crore people of India continue to suffer because of the poison you sowed. Not a single day passes when people of India are not punished for your sins,” said Modi.Modi addressed the House incessant sloganeering by the Opposition. ', 'In a historic move, the first member of the family of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un is slated to visit South Korea. Kim Jong’s sister Kim Yo-Jong will visit Seoul on Friday with a high-level delegation for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Notably, Kim Yo-Jong is a senior member of the ruling Workers’ Party in North Korea.This comes almost a fortnight after the North Korean dictator’s rumoured girlfriend Hyon Song-wol arrived in South Korea ahead of the Winter Olympics to monitor preparations of a North Korean art troupe she is leading. According to The Telegraph, she was greeted by string of shutterbugs. She did not interact with any of the mediapersons.She was also met with protests following her arrival in the rival nation. Conservative South Korean activists burnt a large photo of Kim Jong Un as she arrived in Seoul.According to CNN, Kim Jong-Un’s sister Kim Yo-Jong, who is 30-year-old, was in 2017 promoted to the Politburo of North Korea. After her elevation, the US Treasury Department had reportedly included her on the list of blacklisted officials of North Korea.The move by North Korea might not go down well with the US as the country’s delegation to South Korea is led by Vice President Mike Pence.Yang Moo-Jin, a professor of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said, “It is highly significant that a member of the Kim family is coming to the South for the first time in history.”According to him, the dictator’s sister is likely to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-In and give him a personal letter from her brother, expressing his hopes for a successful hosting of the Olympics and desire to improve inter-Korean ties.“This will mark Kim Yo-Jong’s debut on the international stage,” Yang told AFP. “She is being groomed as one of the North’s most powerful figures by her brother.”She has frequently been seen accompanying her brother on his “field guidance trips” and other events and is known to have been involved in the party’s propaganda operations.The North has always kept its leadership within the family — Kim Jong-Un is the third generation of the dynasty to lead the country, after his father Kim Jong-Il and grandfather Kim Il-Sung, the North’s founder.Kim Jong-Il fathered both Kim Jong-Un and Kim Yo-Jong with his third partner, former dancer Ko Yong-Hui.But other family members have not fared so well — Kim Jong-Un’s uncle was executed for treason two years after the younger man came to power, and his half-brother was assassinated in a Malaysian airport last year.', 'New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its monetary policy announcement on Wednesday kept key interest rates at hold, but its observations on Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rates (MCLR) may bring cheers to Pre-April 2016 home loan borrowers.The home loan rates of the Pre-April 2016 have not been revised by banks in line with market rates. These home loan borrowers, who were stuck in the older base rate regime, will now be linked to the current market-linked benchmark.In its policy statement, RBI has asked banks to link the base rate to MCLR from April 1, 2018 to ensure expeditious transmission of its policy rate to borrowers.RBI introduced the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rates (MCLR) system with effect from April 1, 2016 on account of the limitations of the Base Rate regime.It is observed, however, that a large proportion of bank loans continue to be linked to the Base Rate despite the Reserve Bank of India highlighting this concern in earlier monetary policy statements.“Since MCLR is more sensitive to policy rate signals, it has been decided to harmonise the methodology of determining benchmark rates by linking the Base Rate to the MCLR with effect from April 1, 2018,” RBI saidFormer RBI governor Raghuram Rajan introduced the MCLR to calculate the benchmark lending rate in another attempt to make banks pass on policy rate cut benefits to borrowers quickly and in a more transparent manner.Under the base rate and BPLR, banks were following individual methodologies for computing the minimum rate at which they could lend. Under the MCLR, RBI asked all banks to follow the marginal cost of funds method to arrive at their benchmark lending rate.MCLR is calculated after factoring in banks’ marginal cost of funds (largely, the interest at which they borrow money), return on equity (a measure of banks’ profitability), and negative carry on account of cash reserve ratio.RBI will issue necessary instructions in this regard by the end of next week.', 'Agartala: As election fever grips the poll-bound states in the Northeast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to lead the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) campaign in Tripura on Thursday.

Auto Expo is considered biggest platform in India where car companies show their line up for the year and create buzz in the market. Auto Expo 2018 will see participation from 51 auto companies against 59  in the previous show.Industry sources said that some companies didn’t participate in the Auto Expo due to uncertainty over emission norms and many companies are still trying to form their strategy in view of new norms.

The court granted the relief to Kawa on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and a surety of the same amount, and directed him not to hamper the probe.Kawa was arrested from Terminal-3 of the Delhi airport on January 10 during a joint operation by the Delhi Police and the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), and currently was in judicial custody.In his bail plea, Kawa had claimed that no purpose would be served by keeping him in custody further.The police have alleged that Kawa had received Rs 29.5 lakh from Pakistan to fund the terror attack on the historic Red Fort on December 22, 2000, in which three people, including two Army jawans, were killed.They told the court that Kawa, one of the conspirators in the attack, was absconding for 17 years and had been declared a proclaimed offender.While Kawa was on the run, a trial court in October 2005, awarded death sentence to Pakistan-based LeT terrorist Mohammad Arif alias Ashfaq. Two key conspirators – Nazir Ahmed Qasid and his son Farooq Ahmed Qasid — were awarded life imprisonment.Additional Sessions Judge O P Saini had also awarded seven-year jail term to Ashfaq’s wife Rehmana Yousuf Farooqui, an Indian, for giving shelter to the main accused.Other convicts — Bagar Mohsin Baghwala, Sadaqat Ali and Matloob Alam — were also awarded seven-year rigorous imprisonment.On September 2007, the Delhi High Court had upheld the death sentence to Ashfaq, saying terrorists who have no value for human lives deserved capital punishment.The high court, however, acquitted six others, including Farooqui, citing lack of sufficient evidence against them.', 'Kottayam: The Excise Special Squad at Kottayam seized hashish oil worth Rs 50 lakh from a Kottayam native on Wednesday.Nishanth Paul Kurian, of Erayilkadavu, was taken into custody by the special squad after a raid at his house.

', 'BENGALURU: An 18-year-old engineering student committed suicide by hanging herself at her house reportedly after being bullied by her classmates on Tuesday afternoon.The deceased has been identified as Meghana, a resident of Channasandra and was studying second semester civil engineering at Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering. Her father, Chandrashekar is visually impaired and works at a bank, while her mother Latha is a homemaker. She has an elder sister Bhavana. According to the police, on Tuesday morning she left for college as usual and returned home early while her mother went to drop her father to his office and her elder sister was at her CAD classes.She committed suicide by hanging herself to the ceiling fan. The incident came to light when her mother returned home and informed the police.The family claims that she was bullied by her classmates and they had isolated her. Her parents allege that even after several complaints, the Head of the Department (HOD) did not take any action against them and instead supported them. The family has named Soudhamini, Sandeep, Nikhil, Sandhya and the HoD Rajkumar in their complaint.The victim’s sister Bhavana told Deccan Chronicle that the problem began three months back when her sister stood for the Class Representative post and lost the elections. Her rival team often used to pick fight with and rag her in front of the whole class.Earlier also she was being targeted for small fights, where the HoD supported the other students and blamed her. Meghana was also removed from the class WhatsApp group and they also made sure that no one helped her during the exams.Even the HoD was in the WhatsApp group and in fact he was the one who removed her from the group. She suffered a lot during the exams with no proper study material, she added.Her mother, Latha said that she visited the college in November and requested the HoD to take action against students who were bullying her. But he called the rest of them and asked how they got a seat in the college and insulted her family by indicating that she got in through CET, while others through payment seats. He instead advised her to ‘adjust’ with the rest.She further said that even after several complaints the college did not take any action. Few days back her classmates came near our house and picked up a fight with her. I went and requested them not to trouble her, but they continued to do so.He often came back home crying from college and requested me not to interfere as they had started to pick on that also.Her sister said that she was happy during the semester holidays. The college reopened on January 28 and she didn’t want to go back to the same class where everyone bullied her. We thought of requesting the HoD to change the section and three days back she had approached the HoD, but he did not respond to her request.She was made to sit alone in the class and she was depressed. We blame her classmates who kept bullying her and the college authorities who failed to take any actions against them, these people made her to end her own life, her mother said.The college authorities denied all the allegations made by the family members and said that there are no such class representatives in any sections and no WhatsApp group was created.  The police are investigating the case and are searching for HoD Rajkumar who is absconding.', 'Hyderabad: The LB Nagar police arrested an interstate attention diversion gang for their role in three cases in the city.

The S&P 500 slumped 3.8 percent on Thursday, while the Dow dropped 4.2 percent or over 1,000 points as losses accelerated late in the trading day.The S&P 500 last confirmed a correction in January 2016, when it fell 13.3 percent amid concerns about a slump in oil prices.The S&P closed below the intraday low it had hit on Tuesday, a key level traders had been watching.Thursday marked another day of recent sharp swings including the S&P 500`s biggest drop in more than six years that pulled equities away from record highs.“The dust hasn`t settled yet, and I think both buyers and sellers are trying to figure out what this market really wants to do,” said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner for Meridian Equity Partners in New York.“I would think that this continues to happen for the next few trading sessions for everything to kind of get flushed out.”The retreat in equities had been long awaited by investors as the market climbed to record high after record high with few bumps. The S&P correction is the fifth of this bull market, according to Yardeni Research. The last bear market was during the 2008 financial crisis.The sharp selloff in recent days was kicked off by concerns over rising inflation and bond yields, sparked by Friday`s January U.S. jobs report, with investors pointing to additional pressure from the violent unwinding of trades linked to bets on volatility staying low.Equities for years have looked relatively attractive compared to the low yields offered by bonds, but the rise in Treasury yields has diminished the allure of stocks, especially with stock valuations at historically expensive levels.Earlier on Thursday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield rose as high as 2.884 percent, nearing Monday`s four-year peak of 2.885 percent, after the Bank of England said interest rates probably needed to rise sooner than previously expected.“What we`re seeing today is continued concerns around interest rates going higher, around valuations in the stock market,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer with Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,032.89 points, or 4.15 percent, to 23,860.46, the S&P 500 lost 100.66 points, or 3.75 percent, to 2,581 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 274.83 points, or 3.9 percent, to 6,777.16.All 11 major S&P sectors finished lower, with financials and technology the worst-performing groups. All 30 components of the blue-chip Dow finished negative.Amazon and Facebook two of the big stocks that had led the S&P`s rally over the past year, were among the biggest drags on Thursday.After regular cash trading, S&P 500 e-mini futures edged down 0.2 percent late on Thursday.Thursday`s slide put the S&P 500 back into negative territory for the year, down 3.5 percent.Machine-guided, numbers-obsessed fund managers may keep selling pressure on stocks this week as they come to terms with the market`s wild trading.Investors are weighing whether the sharp swings are the start of a deeper correction or just a temporary bump in the prolonged bull market.A new survey by the American Association of Individual Investors showed the percentage of U.S. individual investors expecting a decline in stock prices has hit a three-month high.Volatility remained high compared to recent months. The market`s main gauge of volatility, the Cboe Volatility Index, rose 5.73 to 33.46 on Thursday, about three times the average level of the past year.Equity options trading volume, already elevated this week, is likely to pick up as February contracts approach expiration next week, said Jon Cherry, head of U.S. options at Northern Trust Capital Markets in Chicago.“A lot of people have been forced to put on positions that will need to be either wound down or rolled forward,” Cherry said.Thursday marked another session this week with strong volume. About 10.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 8.2 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by an 8.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.58-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 113 new lows.', 'NEW DELHI: The Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested an Indian Air Force official for allegedly spying for Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) on Friday.Group Captain Arun Marwah was arrested on charges of leaking top-secret information and documents to Pakistan. These documents contained classified details of Indian Air Force operations.As FIR has been filed under relevant sections of Officials Secrets Act. The officer faces up to seven years in jail.The 51-year-old IAF officer reportedly shared the classified information with a Pakistani agent, who was pretending to be a woman, on WhatsApp.The ISI agent befriended Marwah on Facebook a couple of months ago and the two started chatting regularly on WhatsApp, at times exchanging intimate messages. Eventually, the officer started sharing information on cyber warfare and special operations. The officer was arrested after he walked in with a cellphone, which is barred inside the Air Force headquarters.Sources in the intelligence agencies earlier told Zee Media that ISI is getting increasingly worried about the growing casualties of its officers and jawans.

The talk comes amid the United States’ massive crackdown on Pakistan for its failure to act on terrorism.The two leaders spoke on enhancing security in Indo-Pacific region, Afghan war, ongoing political crisis in the Maldives, the situation of Myanmar’s Rohingya refugees and North Korea`s nuclear program.“Affirming President Trump’s South Asia strategy, they reiterated their commitment to supporting Afghanistan’s security and stability,” the White House said in a readout of the phone call between Trump and PM Modi, the first in 2018.Last month, Trump administration blocked $2-billion military aid to Pakistan. It further plans to freeze more economic aid to the country. However, the US admitted that despite freezing aid, Pakistan continues to harbour terrorism on home soil.“Both leaders expressed concern about the political crisis in the Maldives and the importance of respect for democratic institutions and rule of law,” the White House.A political chaos brewed in the Indian Ocean nation last Thursday, after the country’s top court ordered the release of nine imprisoned Opposition politicians, including former democratically elected president Mohammed Nasheed. On Monday, President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency for 15-days, further deepening the political crisis. Maldives’ Supreme Court Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and another judge, Ali Hameed, were arrested hours after Yameen declared a state of emergency.The two leaders also discussed the plight of Myanmar’s Rohingya refugees. As of now there are some 680,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh putting enormous pressure on the country’s economy. Recently Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed on a roadmap of return of these refugees to their homes in Myanmar. However, the US believes that this is not the right time for the return of Rohingya refugees.The phone call also included a discussion on Kim Jong-un-led North Korea and the nuclear threat posed by the East Asian nation.“Finally, the leaders agreed to strengthen security and economic cooperation as they look forward to the ‘2+2’ ministerial dialogue between their defence and diplomatic officials in April,” the White House said.The ‘2+2 dialogue’ was announced after the White House meeting between PM Modi and Trump in June 2017.The dialogue would involve External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman from India along with their American counterparts Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

Foreign Minister of Maldives Dr Mohamed Asim, the designated Special envoy of the President, was scheduled to be in India on February 8, but the visit was cancelled on the request of the Government of India.”“The Government of the Maldives was informed that the said dates were not suitable for India`s leadership,” it added.Reacting to the recent development, sources in the Indian government said that due protocol was not followed as India was not informed of the purpose of sending the envoy. Moreover, Asim’s counterpart External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj is on a visit to Saudi Arabia and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be on a three-nation tour from tomorrow.“Also we have not seen any real action on the concerns stated by the international community and India. Democratic institutions and the Judiciary continue to be undermined and concerns ignored, these issues need to be properly addressed,” sources said.On Wednesday, the Minister of Economic Development, Mohamed Saeed, departed for China and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Mohamed Asim, went to Pakistan, while on Thursday, the Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Dr Mohamed Shainee departed for Saudi Arabia.“Members of the cabinet, on the direction of President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, will visit friendly nations of the Maldives and provide updates on the current situation,” an official statement said.On Monday, former President of Maldives Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Chief Justice Saeed, Supreme Court Justice Ali Hameed and Judicial administrator Hassan Saeed were arrested by the security forces after Gayoom declared a state of emergency in the country. The arrests indicated that the crackdown on the opposition intensified. The country’s National Defence Force also stormed inside the Supreme Court (SC) premises in Male on Tuesday.The Maldivian capital remained tense as opposition leaders across were being rounded up and placed under detention as Yameen, who has been refusing to obey SC’s orders directing him to release nine prominent leaders from prison, has given sweeping powers to security forces.Last week, the Maldivian Supreme Court acquitted former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed, former Maldivian Vice President Ahmed Adeeb and ordered the reinstatement of the 12 other parliamentary members.Massive protests had erupted after President Gayoom refused to follow the Supreme Court’s ruling to release the key political prisoners and reinstate the 12 MPs.On February 1, the Supreme Court had ruled that all politicians opposed to President Gayoom, including Nasheed, should be released. It had further said that their trials were “politically influenced”.The high-profile prisoners also include self-exiled former President Mohamed Nasheed and former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb.The government has so far refused to implement the order, saying it had concerns about releasing those who were convicted for “terrorism, graft, embezzlement and treason”.Nasheed, the country’s first democratically elected leader, took office in 2008. He was ousted in a coup in February 2012.The country has seen political unrest since he was sentenced to 13 years in jail in 2015 on terrorism charges.

The shocking allegation dates back to the time when the victim was 18-year-old and the noted star was 28.As per IANS, the woman filed a police complaint with Himachal Pradesh’s Director General of Police. The star reportedly ‘arranged’ for the victim to join him from New Delhi to Shimla on the set of his movie without the complainant’s ‘awareness’. The incident took place in January 1971, when the victim was 18 and Jeetendra was 28.In her complaint, the woman has alleged that on the night they reached Shimla, Jeetendra returned to the room in an inebriated state, joined the two separate beds and sexually assaulted her.Now, the noted actor’s lawyer has issued a statement denying all the claims made by the woman in question. BollywoodLife.com quoted advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, who represented the actor as stating, “Foremost my client specifically and categorically denies any such incident. Besides even otherwise such baseless, ridiculous and fabricated claims cannot be entertained by any Court of law or the law enforcement agencies after a span of almost 50 years. The Statute has provided a justice delivery system through the Courts, and the Limitation Act 1963 was specifically enacted to ensure that all genuine complaints are made within a maximum time limit of three years so that a proper investigation is carried out and timely justice is delivered.Besides I want to make it specifically clear that the law does not give any person any rights or liberties of making any baseless, ridiculous or fabricated claims against any man publicly and seek to defame him with a hidden personal agenda. Media is therefore adviced to cautiously refrain from giving any importance to such ridiculous, baseless and fabricated claims, and they should not participate in any way whatsoever in defaming or assassinating the character of any man in such cases.In any event, the timing of this baseless complaint seems to be nothing but a miserable effort made by a jealous competitor to disrupt the business activities of my client and his esteemed Company. Such efforts are therefore in all fairness treated with the contempt it truly deserves.” ', 'Kidnappers of a 20-year-old Britain-based glamour model, who was allegedly abducted in Milan, stuffed her into a suitcase before trying to sell her online as a sex slave. British model Chloe Ayling, mother of one, has recounted the horrific details of her ordeal.Ayling was allegedly abducted in Milan by the kidnappers, who called her down for a fake photoshoot. After being injected with a horse tranquilliser, she was stuffed inside a big suitcase.“A person wearing black gloves came up from behind and put one hand on my neck and the other on my mouth, while a second person, wearing a black balaclava, injected me in my right arm,” said Ayling in a statement to the police, published by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.“I think I lost consciousness. When I woke up I was wearing a pink bodysuit and the socks I’m in now. I realised I was in the boot of a car, with my wrists and ankles tied and my mouth taped. I was inside a bag, with only a small hole that allowed me to breathe.”She was reportedly taken to Borgial – an isolated village near Turin in northern Italy. The abductors, a part the Black Death Group, then tried to sell her on the dark internet for nearly Rs 20 crores (£230,000) and also demanded that her agent pay a ransom.She was reportedly released after the kidnappers realised laws forbade kidnapping mothers. She was asked to keep mum about the incident, and further asked her pay $50,0000 in BitCoins within a month. Failing to do so will result in her death, warned the abductors in a letter.After missing for two days, the agent then informed authorities.The police have now arrested a 30-year-old Lukasz Pawel Herba in Britain on suspicion of kidnapping and extortion.

In all but one case, the researchers found no obvious foetal abnormalities with weekly ultrasounds.The brains of the infected fetuses, however, did grow more slowly than normal, but they remained large enough so that their smaller size did not meet the criteria for Zika virus.“Current criteria using head size to diagnose Zika-related brain injury fail to capture more subtle brain damage that can lead to significant learning problems and mental health disorders later in life,” said Kristina Adams Waldorf, Professor at the varsity.“All children exposed to Zika virus in utero should be followed long-term for problems with learning and development, regardless of head size at birth.“And we should also be worried about children and young adults becoming infected with the Zika virus because they have the same vulnerable stem cells in their brains as the foetus,” Waldorf said.', 'Johannesburg: Star batsman AB de Villiers returned to South Africa’s squad for the remaining three one- day internationals against India, giving a boost to the beleaguered hosts who have lost all their matches so far.De Villiers has been added to South Africa’s squad for the remaining matches, but a call on his availability for the fourth match, to be held at the Wanderers on Saturday, will only be taken after he is assessed at tomorrow’s practice. De Villiers missed the first three games of the six-match series with a finger injury he sustained during the Wanderers Test. His inclusion was the only change to the existing squad.“Having AB back is going to be a massive boost. He will bring confidence to the team and his leadership within the group will add a lot of value as well,” J P Duminy had said after South Africa lost the third ODI at Newlands by 124 runs.The free-scoring de Villiers had bruised an index finger attempting to take a catch in the 63-run defeat in the third Test against the tourists here.De Villiers has scored 9,515 runs in 225 ODIs at an average of more than 54 and a strike rate of 101.

The clash against the Gaurs couldn’t have come at a better time for the hosts, who lost a heated seven-goal thriller at the Fatorda Stadium back in November, best remembered for Blues’ goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu’s idiosyncratic sending-off. FC Goa’s form has been a mixed bag with only two wins in 2018 thus far. On the back of a morale-sapping 3-4 defeat to Mumbai City at home and a 2-2 draw against NorthEast United FC most recently, the Sergio Lobera-coached unit will look to return to winning ways in a crunch period that also sees them host Chennaiyin FC and travel to FC Pune City in the coming weeks.Blues’ head coach Albert Roca is wary of the implications a win could potentially have in the quest for a play-off spot but isn’t taking anything for granted.“Tomorrow we will be playing against a team which I think will be in the top four. Their style of play is interesting, and they like to attack,” Roca said. Attack has certainly the best form of defence for the sixth-placed Goans. They lead the team tally for goals scored with 29 but are third from bottom in terms of goals conceded (23). That leaky defence has cost them in recent weeks, but with two games in hand, it’s not something that necessarily concerns Derrick Pereira. “I think we play as a team and we follow a certain idea. We’ll stick to that and won’t change on those ideas,” the assistant coach said.The attacking line-up proves a treat for fans. The Spanish strike duo of Ferran Corominas and Manuel Lanzarote (eight goals) have led the line brilliantly for FC Goa, with the former topping the golden boot standings on 13 goals. He’ll be in focus across from BFC’s Miku and Sunil Chettri (nine goals).

The police was searching the hotelier after narcotic drugs were found inside a parcel dispatched by him from Kathmandu to the Netherlands during a security check at Frankfurt Airport in Germany, police said.Lary is the owner of Kathmandu’s five-star Everest Hotel, which remained closed after its building developed major cracks in 2015 earthquakes.He has been operating the hotel in Kathmandu for the last 30 years.Police has filed a case on drugs trafficking against Lary in Kathmandu District Court after taking him into custody.', 'Panmunjom: North and South Korea, the Olympic thaw in relations has led to more tourists and VIPs and fewer security incidents, tour operators and international soldiers stationed there say.The demilitarised zone (DMZ) offers visitors coming to South Korea for the Winter Olympics a surreal mix of doomsday military installations and tourist attractions, where gift shops and tour buses mix with razor wire, land mines and massive “rock drops” rigged with explosives to block roads for invading North Korean armies. Tourists can gawk at bullet holes that still mark the site where a North Korean soldier dramatically defected across the border at the Joint Security Area (JSA) in Panmunjom in November, under fire from his former comrades.But the United Nations Command (UNC) officers who help oversee operations here and elsewhere along the 250-km (155-mile) DMZ say they are cautiously hopeful the recent flurry of talks and Olympics-related exchanges between the two Koreas will make their jobs less stressful.South Korea wants to use the Olympics – which officially begin on Friday – to re-engage with North Korea and open the way for talks to resolve one of the world’s most dangerous crises.“The North Koreans certainly seem to be on their best behaviour,” Royal Canadian Navy Commander Robert Watt, chief of staff for the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission, said as he stood just steps from the border on Wednesday.According to the UN command, in 2017 more than 105,000 tourists visited the JSA from South Korea, while nearly 30,000 visited from North Korea, which has expanded its tourist offerings in recent years.South Korean tour operators say tours of the JSA and DMZ are up to 20 to 30 percent above average for this icy time of year, a spike they attribute to the surge of Olympic visitors and the thaw in tensions.“Usually in February not many visitors come to South Korea because it is the off-season,” said Kim Sun-hee, director of Joongang Express Tour.Olympic officials have been expecting more than 80,000 foreign tourists and 75,000 athletes, reporters and other Olympic officials to visit South Korea for the Games.Besides driving more tourists to the border, the Olympics detente seems to have lowered tensions on the border, at least temporarily.Instead of responding to the usual North Korean provocations, Watt said UNC units have been helping process arriving members of North Korea’s Olympic delegation and taking numerous media and international VIPs on tours.One of the largest peacetime crossings of the border was made on Wednesday, with a group of 280 North Koreans entering the South, including a 229-member cheer squad, taekwondo performers, journalists and the sports minister.Hope for TalksSouth Korea and the US-led UNC force are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.Tensions on the border were already high following a series of bellicose exchanges in 2017 between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before the North Korean soldier defected in late November.Oh Chong Song was shot multiple time as he scrambled to the south side of the JSA compound. Several shots hit buildings in the South, and a North Korean guard briefly ran across the border as he pursued the defector.That incident led to the North Koreans replacing the entire detachment of soldiers assigned to the JSA, increasing security measures in the area. North Korean soldiers now only rarely stand close to the official border, Watt said.Another North Korean soldier defected across the border in December, and South Korean border guards fired warning shots along the DMZ at an apparent North Korean search party.Since inter-Korean talks began last month, however, South Korean and international troops report fewer cross-border incidents by the North Koreans, Watt said, raising hopes that tensions could ease.The UNC troops at the border are quick to note they are not a peacekeeping force, and often go out of their way to tell of North Korean provocations. But Watt said his troops try to also remind visitors that while tense, the current situation is better than the horrors of the Korean War.', 'Canberra: In a landmark move, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnball announced that he will make a national apology to survivors of child sex abuse before the end of the parliamentary year.Apologising to victims of institutional abuse amid the royal commission into child sex abuse, the prime minister confirmed the intentions of the government on Thursday, The Guardian reported. “We owe it to survivors not to waste this moment and we must continue to be guided by their wishes,” Turnbull said. “As a nation, we must mark this occasion in a form that reflects the wishes of survivors and that affords them the dignity to which they were entitled as children – but which was denied to them by the very people who were tasked with their care.”Turnball also confirmed the appointment of a “survivor-focused reference group” which will help draft the apology.The final report of the royal commission has words “that shake us to our core,” Labour leader Bill Shorten said, adding “The child with disability, abused daily, who couldn’t get a disinterested police officer to take any notice of their plea for help.”“The good Catholic boy, who, after each time he was abused sexually by his priest, had to go to confession and confess his sin of impurity – to his abuser. And then this boy, this child being preyed upon by this monster, would be asked if he was sorry. And told to do three Hail Marys for his penance,” he said.“They were children, seen and not heard. They could not find a counsellor to listen to their story, they could not find justice in the criminal court or compensation in the civil…These institutions failed our fellow Australians – and then our nation did.”The prime minister in his statement requested the parliament for an update on the redressal schemes for survivors and proposed USD 150,00 as the amount for cap payments.Institutions in which abuse had taken place will be urged to reach out to victims personally, the statement added.The issue is set be discussed at Friday’s Council of Australian Governments meeting in Canberra, where Turnball is expected to ask states to sign up to the scheme.', 'Bengaluru: The body of a two-year-old boy was found in a forest in Soladevanahalli police station limits, a day after he went missing near his house. The police have arrested his 14-year-old neighbour in this connection. The accused allegedly smothered the victim, Venkatesh, son of Basavaraju, owner of a roadside eatery, by pressing his foot against his neck. He did this to avenge the humiliation of his father Eeranna, a tea seller, by Basavaraju.On Wednesday afternoon, around 2 pm, while Venkatesh was playing in front of his house, a pigeon belonging to Eeranna’s son flew to the nearby forest area. He called Venkatesh, who was fond of pigeons, to help him find the bird. Both went to the forest, but only Eeranna’s son returned. Later in the evening, when Venkatesh did not return home, Basavaraju and his family started searching for him. After some time, Basavaraju was informed by a neighbour that his son was lying dead in the forest. Basavaraju then approached the police and lodged a complaint accusing Eeranna of murdering his son to avenge their stand-off on February 4. The police detained Eeranna, but they found that he was not present at the spot between 2 pm and 3 pm on Wednesday, the time when the murder was suspected to have happened. The police suspected involvement of Eeranna’s son in the murder and detained him, with the help of Child Welfare Committee members, for the questioning. During the questioning, Eeranna’s son confessed to the crime and was sent to the state-run boys’ home.', 'COIMBATORE: A 47-year-old doctor was imprisoned here on Thursday for alleged sexual harassment of a trainee-nursing student by attempting to molest the poor girl after administrating her anesthetic injection and for an alleged action replay bid with a few other nursing students of the same group.  Police said Dr Raveendran, who runs a private hospital near Singanallur, had as his guests a group of 11 first-year Nursing diploma students from a Dindigul institute including a 17-year-old girl, who had come down to the hospital for training.  Even as the training was going on, the girl had a few days ago approached Dr Raveendran seeking medicine for her severe cold. But the doctor, allegedly, along with an injection for treating cold, administered an anesthetic injection claiming it was a vitamin source. When the girl started to feel drowsy the doctor had allegedly molested her. After a long struggle, the girl escaped from his room and was found lying in a semi-conscious state in the hospital’s verandah. Shocked at seeing her condition, the other trainee-students turned panic and took up the issue with the doctor’s wife, who pacified the students and promised them that such incidents will never recur in the hospital.However, with few other trainee-students facing the same predicament, the girls promptly sent a message to the Coimbatore child line coordinator, police said. After enquiring with the students, the child line centre’s coordinator Ms. Sulekha lodged a complaint against Dr Raveendran at the Coimbatore east wing all women’s police station.Based on her complaint, inspector Masudha Begum arrested Dr Raveendran. He was produced before a local court and remanded to judicial custody. ', 'Chennai: Pointing out that when a father’s asset is passed on to his son, after his death, so are his liabilities, the Madras High Court on Thursday directed a son to pay the unpaid compensation to the family of the deceased, who died while cleaning a septic tank in a house at Kottivakkam, where his father lived in 2001.“The concept of pious obligation originated in Dharmasastras, according to which, non-payment of debt is a sin, which results in unbearable suffering in the next world. Just as Lord Rama was obligated to fulfill his deceased father’s promise to his step-mother, similarly, the petitioner is obliged to pay compensation to the deceased worker’s family, which is imposed on his father”, said Justice S. Vaidyanathan while partly allowing a petition from A.Ravichandran alias Ravi. According to petitioner, his father G.Arumugham purchased a property in Kottivakkam and settled the property in his favour in 2015. The Chennai Corpo\\nration by a communication dated August 21, 2017, asked him to pay a sum of `10 lakh as liability to one Adhilakshmi, who was the legal heir of late Narasim\\nhan, who died on August 26, 2001 while cleaning the drainage in the house, where his father lived. The compensation had already been paid by his father immediately to the family of the deceased.The judge said it was very clear that three employees have gone from the office of Kottivakkam panchayat to the residence of the petitioner’s father without obtaining any permission from the office of Panchayat. There was no reason as to why no memo was given to the person, who gave the FIR that the employee had gone to the petitioner’s residence without permission.The contention of the petitioner that the septic tank was outside the premises was not correct, as the pipelines and the septic tank were inside the house. In view of the Supreme Court decision, it was clear that dependents of persons, who died on account of doing sewerage work, since 1993 were entitled for compensation of `10 lakh for each such death, the judge added. The judge said even though the delay was exorbitant, that cannot be a ground to reject the claim of the family members of the deceased. This court was of the view that the impugned order asking the petitioner to pay the compensation to the dependent of the deceased, cannot be said to be illegal. As the petitioner and the Chennai Corporation  were jointly,  severally and\\nvicariously responsible to pay compensation to the dependent of the deceased Narasimhan, this court modifies the impugned order to the extent that a sum of `7.50 lakh will have to be paid the victim’s family, out of which, `5 lakh shall be paid by the petitioner and the remaining by the Chennai Corporation, the judge added.', 'NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Friday start his three-nation tour to the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Palestine. Ahead of his visit, the Prime Minister on Thursday said that the Gulf and West Asia region is a key priority for India’s foreign policy.“I will be undertaking bilateral visits to Palestine, United Arab Emirates and Oman from February 9 to 12,” Modi said in a pre-departure statement.“I am happy to visit the Gulf and West Asian region for the fifth time since 2015. This region is a key priority in our external engagement,” he said, adding India enjoys “vibrant multi-dimensional ties” with its countries.According to authorities and business leaders, this visit of the Prime Minister signifies the special importance that India attaches to its ties with the oil-rich nation and will help in furthering cooperation in diplomatic, economic and security issues.On Friday, Modi will leave for Amman from where he will transit to Ramallah on Saturday in what will be the first ever Prime Ministerial visit from India to Palestine.“I am grateful to His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan for facilitating the transit,” he said. “I look forward to meeting him in Amman on February 9.”During his historic visit to Palestine, Modi will hold a meeting with the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. He said he was looking forward to discussions with the Palestinian President and “reaffirming our support for the Palestinian people and the development of Palestine”.This will be the fourth meeting between Modi and Abbas after their meetings on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in 2015 and at the Paris climate summit later that year and the Palestinian President’s visit to India last year.The visit will reaffirm India’s foreign policy position that its relationship with one country is independent of its ties with a third country and will de-hyphenate Israel and Palestine after Modi’s standalone visit to Israel in July last year.From Palestine, Modi will reach Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), on February 10 evening in what will be his second visit to the nation since his visit in August 2015.“In UAE, I will hold talks with His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi,” the Prime Minister said.Modi will hold talks with the Crown Prince soon after his arrival following which several agreements will be signed. The next day, he will meet members of the Indian community and lay the foundation stone of a temple via video link.From Abu Dhabi, Modi will proceed to Dubai where he will deliver the keynote address at the Sixth World Government Summit.“At the invitation of the leadership of the UAE, I will be addressing the 6th edition of the World Government Summit in Dubai, where India is the guest country of honour.“There will be interactions with leading UAE and Arab CEOs in Dubai on the vast economic opportunities in India and what more can be done together to increase business collaboration.”From Dubai, Modi will reach Muscat on February 11 in what will be the first prime ministerial from India to Oman in 10 years since the visit of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2008.“Oman is a close maritime neighbour with whom we enjoy excellent relations,” the Prime Minister said, adding that India and Oman have thriving links rooted in centuries old people-to-people exchanges.Modi will hold talks with Sultan Qaboos Bin Said Al Said and also meet Deputy Prime Minister for the Council of Ministers Sayyid Fahd and Deputy Prime Minister for International Relations and Cooperation Affairs Sayyid Asad.“We will review bilateral cooperation and steps to further enhance our traditionally strong links,” he said.“On February 12, I will interact with leading businesspersons of Oman on developing stronger economic and business links with India,” he added.Modi said that both in the UAE and Oman, he will meet the large Indian diasporas that have made those countries their home.“The Indian diaspora is a bridge of friendship between India and the Gulf countries,” he said.While the UAE is home to over three million expatriate Indians, the number is over 800,000 in Oman.', 'CHENNAI: A portrait of Tamil Nadu’s former chief minister and iconic AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa will be unveiled in the state assembly on February 12.According to ANI, the portrait of Tamil Nadu’s iconic leader will be unveiled by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palanisamy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the event.PM Modi had been earlier approached by the Palanisamy government with a request to grace the event.The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister had sometimes back visited New Delhi during which he had requested the PM Modi to unveil the portrait of the late AIADMK leader.In the invite to PM Modi, Palaniswami had said that Jayalalithaa had dedicated her entire life to the cause of Tamils worldwide and left an indelible mark on the Indian political landscape. ”She had made significant contributions by taking up the cause of Tamil Nadu, its language, culture and development,” it said.“A towering personality and statesman like you (PM), who has upheld the finest traditions of our vibrant democracy and maintained the cherished values of our Parliamentary system, would be the befitting person to unveil the portrait of our revered leader. The people of TN would be extremely happy if you could kindly consent to unveil the portrait,” Palaniswami had said.However, PM Modi’s tight schedule did not allow him to attend the event earlier.The move then set off strident opposition from the political parties since Jayalalithaa was convicted in a disproportionate assets case.Lovingly referred as ‘Amma’ by her supporters, Jayalalithaa passed away on December 5, 2016, after suffering from prolonged illness.Jayalalithaa was admitted to Apollo Hospital in September 2016 for dehydration.Later her condition got complicated. On December 5, 2016, there were rumours about Jayalalithaa’s death in the evening which Apollo Hospital denied but later it was announced that she died around 11.30 pm on that day.She was in the hospital for 75 days before she breathed her last.Her death shattered the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) into factions, and after much unrest, Palanisamy finally assumed the office of the chief minister on February 16, 2017.Recently on January 12, the Apollo Hospital, where former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa was treated, submitted documents pertaining to her treatment to an inquiry commission set up by the state government to investigate the matter.According to ANI, the top management of the Apollo Hospital handed over the treatment record of Jayalalithaa, packed in two suitcases, to the one-member commission, formed by the Tamil Nadu government.The commission had also ordered jailed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala’s advocate Raja Senthurapandian to appear before it on January 22. On January 6, Sasikala had sought the copies of testimonies given by various witnesses against her in connection with Jayalalithaa’s death. Sasikala, who has been jailed in a multi-crore disproportionate assets case, had filed an affidavit through her lawyer Raja Senthurapandian in this regard.Earlier on December 22, the commission had summoned Sasikala and Apollo Hospital founder-Chairman Pratap Reddy in this matter. Following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, allegations of foul play began to do the rounds and state forest minister Dindigul Sreenivasan later claimed that all cabinet ministers had lied to the people about hospitalisation and death of the former Tamil Nadu CM.Subsequently, a one-man commission was constituted and a probe under a retired Madras High Court judge, Justice Arumugasamy, was initiated on October 30.The commission, whose constitution was challenged in the Supreme Court through a plea, which the apex court later rejected, is likely to submit its findings in the first quarter of this year. ', 'An Army camp in Sunjwan area of Jammu and Kashmir was attacked on Saturday by terrorists, believed to be associated with Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). During the operation, the Indian Army gunned down three terrorists during the face-off that went on for several hours.According to intelligence sources, Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin and JeM chief Masood Azhar are the mastermind of the attack on the Army camp.Reports cited intercepts from Pakistan and said that a meeting between the chiefs of the terror groups was held recently in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The two groups also reportedly organised a terrorist camp in Muzaffarabad.The terrorists who attacked the Army camp were reportedly trained at this training camp and then sent to the Indian side of the border.The terrorists, however, were met with strong retaliation by the Indian forces, who gunned down at least three of them. Some AK-47 assault rifles and other weapons were also recovered from the terrorists neutralised by the security forces.“Search of their belongings confirmed that the terrorists belonged to JeM. So far, one JCO and 1 NCO, both belonging to J&K, have been martyred and 9 others are injured. Two of them being critical,” the Defence PRO had said.Following the attack, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti chaired an emergency meeting with top state government officials, including J&K Police DGP SP Vaid. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Abdul Rehman Veeri informed the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly that Subedar Madanlal Chowdhary and Subedar Mohammed Ashraf Mir were killed in the attack by a group of militants.Army helicopters and drones have been pressed into service to ascertain the exact location of the terrorists. While there was no action around the main entrance and vehicles were moving along the Jammu-Lakhanpur bypass in front of the camp, Army personnel in bullet-proof vehicles were engaged in the operation to rescue people from the family quarters in the rear side of the base.Contingents of para-military CRPF and police personnel were also posted outside the boundary wall and were keeping curious onlookers at bay to avoid civilian casualties. Generators and searchlights were brought to the camp, apparently for a night assault.', 'Gaza Strip: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently touring West Asia, was on Saturday conferred with the ‘Grand Collar’ of the State of Palestine.Ther award was bestowed on him by Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas in recognition of his contribution to strengthening the age-old relationship between India and Palestine.The award was conferred on PM Modi after the conclusion of a bilateral meeting with President Abbas.Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas met Prime Minister Narendra Modi & conferred him with the Grand Collar of the state of Palestine pic.twitter.com/AgjFin8Vje— ANI (@ANI) February 10, 2018Commendation of Grand Collar read,”in recognition of his wise leadership, lofty national and  international stature, in appreciation of his efforts to promote historic relations between  Palestine and India; in acknowledgement of his support to our people’s right to freedom so that peace prevails in region” Commendation of Grand Collar read,\"in recognition of his wise leadership,lofty national & intn\\'l stature,in appreciation of his efforts to promote historic relations b/w Palestine & India;in acknowledgement of his support to our ppls\\' right to freedom so peace prevails in region” pic.twitter.com/mnM6Km7bPy— ANI (@ANI) February 10, 2018The Grand Collar is Palestine’s highest order given to foreign dignitaries.PM Narendra Modi had arrived in Ramallah this morning on a historic visit, which made him the first Indian Prime Minister to make an official visit to Palestine.PM Modi flew in a Jordanian army helicopter straight from Amman to Ramallah, where he was received by his Palestinian counterpart Rami Hamdallah.Prime Minister Modi’s chopper was escorted by choppers from Israel Air Force.“This is a historic visit that will lead to stronger bilateral cooperation,” Modi said shortly after landing.The Prime Minister, accompanied by Hamdallah, visited the Mausoleum of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah and laid a wreath at the grave of the iconic Palestinian leader.The mausoleum was unveiled on November 10, 2007, and is located adjacent to the Palestinian Presidential compound, also known as Muqata’a here.After paying homage to Arafat, the Prime Minister took a short tour of the Arafat Museum located adjacent to the mausoleum.Later, President Abbas received Prime Minister Modi in an official ceremony at the presidential headquarters in Ramallah before starting official talks.The two leaders exchanged hugs and stood for the national anthem of the two countries and then inspected the guard of honour. They shook hand with Palestinian and Indian officials.The two leaders then stepped inside the presidential office for official talks.After the talks, they will sign bilateral agreements, hold a joint press conference and share lunch before Modi leaves for Amman in a chopper.Archbishop of Catholic Church, Poulos Marcuzzo, and religious leaders of the Al-Aqsa mosque have also come to the Muqata’a to greet Modi.Describing India as a “very respected country in the international arena”, the 82-year-old Palestinian President had earlier said that India can have a possible role in creating a multilateral forum of negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis to reach a final agreement.According to Abbas, Modi’s visit to the region reflects India’s long-held position of supporting peace and stability in the region.During his maiden visit to Israel last year, Modi did not travel to Ramallah, the Palestinian seat of government. His standalone visit to Israel had led to many analysts questioning the future of the Indo-Palestine ties.This time Modi skipped Israel in a clear message that India is de-hyphenating its ties with Israel and Palestine.Modi’s visit to Palestine comes amid heightened tensions in the region after US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.The unilateral US decision to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was challenged at the UN General Assembly where 128 nations, including India, voted to turn down the move as “null and void”.Trump’s decision to declare Jerusalem as Israel’s capital angered the Palestinians, sparked protests in the Middle East and raised concern that it could further destabilise the region.Though India has shied away from becoming a party in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the Palestinian leader on several occasions has stressed on a possible role for New Delhi in the Middle East peace process.India believes in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully.The two-state solution envisions independent Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting side by side peacefully. The Palestinians see east Jerusalem as their future capital. ', 'Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday stressed on the need to make examinations simpler after over 10 lakh students reportedly skipped the state board tests in the last four days.Reacting to the issue, CM Yogi said that a fear of exams has been created among students.The sharp decline in the figure comes in the wake of steps taken by the Uttar Pradesh government against the education mafia that aid in the use of unfair means.“When we said let’s conduct a cheating-free exam (then) 10 lakhs students dropped out. This is the figure until now. I don’t know what will happen in future,” Adityanath said.The saint-politician, however, said that ”we are observing and we will not leave it at this.””It is necessary to think on how exams could be further simplified,” he said.The firebrand BJP leader suggested that exams should not be looked upon as a challenge but as a part of the daily routine.The Chief Minister said that the parents and teachers should not impose any kind of barriers on students and provide them with a conducive climate to cope with exams.Yogi Adityanath further claimed that nearly six lakh youths had enrolled for a skill development programme in the last 10 months.Of these, 2.5 lakh youth cleared the tests and more than 1.4 lakh youths got placement and were earning between Rs 15,000 to 40,000 sitting in villages.He said the use of technology in 14,000 ration shops in the state was helping to save of Rs 35 crore a month.

It adds that if a party keeps a convicted person as its office bearer, the registration of such political party must be cancelled with immediate effect.However, the top court has said that it would not look into the issue of convicted persons being a part of any political party or forming a different party, but would consider EC’s demand to get the power to de-register a political party.The next hearing in the case will be held on Monday.', 'New Delhi: Age is just a number. Well, now the claim has been substantiated by a team of scientists, who found that positive attitude towards ageing can reduce the risks of dementia in older adults.According to the Yale University study, older persons with positive age beliefs are 50 percent less likely to develop dementia than their peers who held negative age beliefs.The study examined whether culture-based age beliefs influence the risk of developing dementia among older people, including those who carry the high-risk gene variant.The researchers studied a group of 4,765 people and found that positive age beliefs can reduce the risk of one of the most established genetic risk factors for dementia.The study demonstrated that APOE e4, a high-risk gene variant, carried with positive beliefs about ageing had a 2.7 percent risk of developing dementia, compared to a 6.1 percent risk for those with negative beliefs about ageing, over the four-year study duration.Dementia primarily afflicts older people and is marked by memory loss and an inability to perform tasks.The study is published in the journal PLOS ONE.', 'New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India on Thursday launched third generation of its hatchback Swift at an introductory price Rs 4.99  lakh (ex-showroom).Built on Suzuki’s innovative 5th Gen Heartect platform, the all-new Swift has a superior power to weight ratio with an improved acceleration performance.It had last month opened bookings for the new Swift.

But popularity comes with its own share of detractors too, as Tamannaah may have recently learnt. The actress became the victim of a miscreant’s frivolous behaviour. Recently, a footwear was hurled at Tamannaah by a 31-year-old man at a jewellery store in Hyderabad.  When asked about the same, Tamannaah said, “You can’t help when somebody reacts in a certain way. There was a lot of security at the venue.” “As an actor, we keep quiet when people welcome us with flowers.

It left enough leeway for the passion and exuberance of the actor in the Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie, but there’s more to this than meets the eye. A source close to the project spills the beans and says, “Ranveer claims to have been so traumatised playing Khilji, that he had to visit the psychiatrist. All this was Ranveer’s enthusiasm talking. He’s such a natural at his job, he gets into character in a jiffy. Ranveer would be laughing and joking on the sets. And the minute he was in front of the camera, he would exude red-hot evil. There was no trauma or emotional baggage.”Interestingly, the dance steps in Ranveer’s Khalibali song and dance were apparently inspired by American rock music legend, Jim Morrison. “Sanjay had seen the music videos of Morrison performing live on stage. He told Ranveer to look at them,” says the source. Ranveer is also done with playing evil roles for a while now. He won’t say yes to anything negative for now, the source reveals. ', 'Melbourne: Australia cruised to a seven-wicket victory over England with more than five overs to spare to remain unbeaten after three games in the triangular Twenty20 series in Melbourne on Saturday.The Australians restricted England to 137 for seven off their 20 overs with paceman Kane Richardson taking three wickets and then the home team knocked up the runs off just 14.3 overs. A match-winning partnership of 65 between Glenn Maxwell (39) and D’Arcy Short (36 not out), plus cameos from Chris Lynn (31) and Aaron Finch (20 not out from five balls), got Australia comfortably home.The win ensured Australia will play in the tri-series final in Auckland on February 21 with preliminary matches now switching to New Zealand.The game-defining sequence came when Maxwell and Short accelerated the score from 65 for two at the end of the ninth over to 104 for two after the 11th, 39 runs flowing over just two overs.“Our players have been in tremendous form coming off the Big Bash League and they are playing with freedom and they’re playing fearless,” Australia skipper David Warner said.“The bowlers executed their game beautifully and the way the batters finished it off was absolutely clinical.” But Warner’s form is again in the spotlight after his relentless playing schedule. This time he lasted just four balls, nicking a David Willey outswinger on two.Warner is the only member of the Test side to have played for Australia in every format this summer and has struggled for form in the ODIs and T20s. He is expected to travel with the T20 side to New Zealand before heading straight to South Africa for the first of four Tests.It was a second drubbing for England after going down by five wickets to Australia in Hobart on Wednesday.“It was another poor performance for us,” stand-in captain Jos Buttler said. “We didn’t quite soak up the pressure early on with the bat losing early wickets to back it up for the end and none of us kicked on.“Again the power of Australia proved too much.” Buttler was deputising for injured skipper Eoin Morgan, who missed the match after straining his right groin during training on Friday.Brief scores: England 137/7 in 20 overs (Buttler 46, Richardson 3/33, Stanlake 2/28) lost to Australia 138/3 in 14.3 overs (Short 36*, Maxwell 39).', 'New Delhi: Ankita Raina and Karman Kaur Thandi won their singles matches to help India retain their place in Fed Cup’s Asia/Oceania Group I with a 2-0 win over Chinese Taipei in the relegation play-off here on Saturday.Karman beat Lee Pei-Chi 7-6(4), 6-3 to put India ahead 1-0. Ankita then overcame Chieh-Yu Hsu 6-4, 5-7, 6-1 in two hour and 54 minutes to keep the hosts in the group. Japan qualified for the World Group play-off, beating Kazakhstan 2-1.Ankita remained unbeaten in her singles matches in the India leg of the tournament, winning all her four matches.She hit a lot of angled balls to her left-handed opponents’ backhand, a strategy that paid her good dividends. Ankita took some time to settle down, fending off four breakpoints in the opening game. She broke Hsu in the fourth and eighth games to take the first set.The battle intensified in the second set. Hsu broke Ankita in the fifth and then saved three breakpoints in the next game. Ankita broke back two times but lost serve in the 11th game, allowing the Taipei player to served out the set in the 12th.Hsu took a medical timeout to treat her left shoulder immediately after drawing parity. It broke her momentum helping Ankita to win.', 'Hong Kong: The driver of a double-decker bus that overturned in Hong Kong killing at least 18 people and injuring more than 60 was arrested on Saturday evening for dangerous driving, police said.Images from the scene showed rescuers trying to reach passengers trapped inside the bus, which lay on its side with part of its roof torn off near the town of Tai Po in the northern New Territories.It appeared to have slid on its side and hit a lamppost which smashed into the upper decks of the vehicle.Among the dead were 14 males and four females, police said.The driver has been arrested on charges of causing death and grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving.Ten of the injured were in critical condition, while another 20 were seriously wounded, officials said.Most of the dead and injured were on the upper deck of the bus, Chan Hing-yu of the fire department told reporters.The driver was suspected of being over the speed limit as he went down a slope and lost control of the vehicle, senior traffic superintendent Lee Chi-wai told reporters. He was not in need of any medical treatment after the crash and was be sober, he added. Speaking to local media, passengers said the bus was going to fast before the crash.“It was much faster than I normally felt in a bus,” one injured passenger told the South China Morning Post`s online edition.“And then it was like the tyre slipped, and the bus turned. It was really chaotic in the bus. People fell on one another and got tossed from side to side,” he said.Before the crash, passengers had complained to the driver who was reportedly 10 minutes late and he then started speeding up, the Apple Daily reported, quoting injured passengers at the scene.One injured passenger told the Oriental Daily said it was like the driver was “intentionally using the bus to throw a tantrum.”Lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting of the Democratic Party urged the government to rethink the design of double-decker buses saying the upper decks had been “repeatedly torn off in accidents, posing a serious threat to passengers on the upper level”.He also called the government to address the issue of many drivers working overly long hours. City leader Carrie Lam, who visited survivors at the Prince of Wales Hospital late on Saturday, expressed “deep sorrow” and pledged there would be an independent investigation.The southern Chinese city promotes its public transport system as one of the best infrastructures in the world but fatal accidents do occasionally happen.Hong Kong`s worst road traffic accident occurred in 2003 when a double-decker bus collided with a truck and plunged from a bridge, killing 21 people.In 2008, 18 people were killed in another bus crash.Fourteen people were injured last April when a double-decker tram tipped over, with a 23-year-old driver later arrested for dangerous driving causing harm to others.The safety of Hong Kong`s notoriously crowded waterways has also remained under scrutiny since 39 people were killed when a high-speed ferry and a pleasure boat crashed in 2012.', 'Chicago: A winter storm swept across the northern US Midwest on Friday, dumping up to nine inches (23 cm) of snow on Chicago, killing at least two people and snarling hundreds of flights as it rolled east to threaten New York state and New England.Chicago’s metropolitan area was blanketed with its heaviest snowfall since at least late 2016 as the storm put an icy grip on much of Wisconsin, northern Illinois and Michigan.A man in his 60s died of a heart attack on Friday after he shovelled show, Keith Hartenberger, spokesman for Edward Hospital in Naperville, Illinois, said in a phone interview.A 33-year-old woman also died after a multi-vehicle crash on Friday near Fenton, Michigan, located south of Flint, Fenton police said.The snow caused dozens of crashes on icy Chicago expressways as residents of the third-biggest US city struggled to get to work and to dig out from a storm system that had stretched from Montana to Michigan.“I hate you, Chicago!” Ieva Urbietyte, a 25-year-old customer service representative, said while cleaning snow off her car in the Windy City. “Thankfully we don’t have to do this all the time.”Weather forecasters in Detroit warned that snowfall there could surpass one inch (2.5 cm) an hour as the system headed east.At the Argus Farm Stop in nearby Ann Arbor, Michigan, several customers arrived on skis, and store manager Laura Barch said she was eager to get into her snowshoes.“I feel like this is going to be the one day out of the year” to use them, said Barch. “This is the first real winter we’ve had in several years.”Wind chill temperatures were expected to drop below zero Farenheit (minus 18 degree Celsius) in many areas across the upper Midwest.The central and northern Rockies also will see heavy snow, the National Weather Service said.City officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said on Friday that the system was likely to drop another four or five inches (10 or 12.5 cm) of snow on the Midwest as it headed east toward New England.The storm could dump up to a foot (30 cm) of snow in New York state as it picks up moisture off the Great Lakes, he added.About 1,600 US flights were cancelled, with about a third of flights into or out of Chicago and Detroit airports called off, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks airline traffic.Winter weather this week killed people in accidents in the Midwest, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.', 'New Delhi: Rahul Gandhi on Saturday launched a scathing attack at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for telling the Parliament on Thursday that the previous Congress-led government had declined, on 15 occasions, to disclose defence purchases details.Gandhi pulled out three instances where the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had disclosed the purchase details of heavyweight buys like the Sukhoi and Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft.“You said the UPA never released prices of defence purchases. To nail your lie, here are 3 parliamentary replies by the UPA with full transparency on pricing,” the Congress president tweeted, making it clear that he can not be daunted from the campaign demanding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government come clean on the Rs 58,000 crore Rafale deal.“Now do ask our Raksha Mantri (Defence Minister) to tell India how much each RAFALE jet cost,” Rahul added.The Congress has been hinting that the government’s adamant denial to release the figures is an indicator that there is “something fishy.”The party also alleges that India is paying more for the multi-role jets to France’s Dassault than what had originally been agreed between the company and the Congress-led UPA government.Rahul again started his Friday’s tweet with ‘Dear Jaitlie.’Dear Mr Jaitlie,You said the UPA never released prices of Defence purchases?To nail your lie, here are 3 Parliamentary replies by the UPA with full transparency on pricing.

There has been some irregularity in the Rafale deal and the government is hiding behind the confidentiality clause to avoid answers,” said Mallikarjun Kharge, the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha.', 'New Delhi: The government has appointed Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta as the special public prosecutor in the 2G spectrum allocation cases for the CBI after the agency’s case was rejected by a special court.An order issued on February 8 by the Department of Personnel and Training in the official gazette, said, “The central government hereby appoints Tushar Mehta, Advocate, as Special Public Prosecutor for conducting prosecution, appeals/revisions or other proceedings arising out of the cases related to 2G Spectrum investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment (CBI) in the Court of Special Judge (2G Spectrum cases), Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi, and appellate/revisional courts.” The notification did not mention about present special public prosecutor Anand Grover who was recommended by KK Venugopal, the Attorney General, when he was representing the agency in the Supreme Court.Grover had replaced UU Lalit after he was elevated as a Supreme Court Judge.Grover was appointed as the special public prosecutor by a Bench of the Supreme Court led by the then Chief Justice of India HL Dattu.The apex court had on August 12, 2014 asked Venugopal to suggest three names for appointment as the SPP.The bench, which opened the sealed envelope on September 2, 2014 had said Venugopal suggested only one name and it was accepting his proposal to appoint Grover as SPP to conduct the trial in the cases arising out of 2G scam.Reacting to the development, senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan said on twitter, “Government brazenly changes SPL (special) public prosecutor of 2G case appointed by Supreme Court and appoints Modi/Shah’s main lawyer Tushar Mehta as prosecutor in gross violation of Supreme Court’s order.

Fisherman Thamilarasu (35) of CG Colony, Kasimedu and his friends were said to be playing cards on a boat docked at Kasimedu harbour on Friday night. Kasimedu policemen, while on rounds, tried to apprehend them. Police chased the fleeing fishermen and a cop allegedly threw his lathi at them, a fisherman said. “The impact of the lathi injured Thamilarasu’s eye and he subsequently fell into the sea and went missing,” the fishermen alleged.Police and local fishermen found his body onshore later. Meanwhile, the news of Thamilarasu’s death spread among other fishermen and they protested on Saturday morning, seeking action against the policemen who had allegedly chased Thamilarasu.Thamilarasu’s wife Deepika and relatives refused to allow the post-mortem and demanded a government job. However, police officers pacified the agitators.', 'Honnavar: Police have arrested two more people in connection with Paresh Mesta murder case. A police team, led by Honnavar CPI Cheluvaraj, succeeded in arresting Faizal Annigeri and Imthiaz at Sirsi in Uttar Kannada district. Paresh Mesta, of Honnavar, had gone missing after a clash between two groups on December 6. Two days later his body was found in a lake.Based on the complaint filed by Paresh’s father against five people, the police had already arrested three. With the latest arrest all the five have been arrested. Sources said that Faizal had returned from Saudi Arabia, where he was working, a few months ago, while Imthiaz is a scrap dealer. Faizal and Imthiaz were arrested on charges of rioting and produced before a judge, who sent them to judicial custody. They were said to be part of the mob which was involved in communal clash on December 6 and they are suspected to be involved in Paresh Mesta’s mysterious disappearance and murder. Saffron outfits had alleged that this was a case of murder by Jihadi groups. The protest in Kumta and Sirsi against the alleged murder of Paresh had turned violent.', 'Bengaluru: A 30-year-old techie was allegedly murdered by her husband at his restaurant in Sampangirama Nagar and he took the body to Kamandoddi forest in Tamil Nadu and burnt it. The incident took place a month ago, but came light after the husband’s arrest on February 6. The deceased, Akshatha, worked as a software engineer in a private firm at Hebbal. She got married to Chandrakanth, who owns a restaurant, 10 years ago and they have a 4-year-old son. Chandrakanth suspected his wife was having an affair and the couple used to have frequent fights over this.According to the police, on January 9 Chandrakanth fought with his wife and in fit of anger he strangulated her to death. He hid her body in his restaurant and called his friend Rajvindhar Singh for help. The duo waited till night and put the body into their car and drove it towards Tamil Nadu. They stopped their vehicle near Kamandoddi forest and burnt the body using diesel. Rajvindhar took her phone and went to Hyderabad, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and other cities, while Chandrakanth returned home and informed everyone that she was out on an official trip. On January 23, Akshatha’s mother, Rekha filed a missing complaint with the Sampangirama Nagar police station. In her complaint she stated that on January 9, around 12 noon, she and her daughter had gone to Chandrakanth’s Silver Spoon hotel and restaurant to meet him.Akshatha told her to wait till she returns and went inside the hotel. When she did not return after half an hour she went to enqire at the hotel. Chandrakath told her that she had left long ago after taking Rs 50,000 from him. She told the police that she initially thought Akshatha had gone to meet friends or relatives. But after she checked with everyone and later tried to contact Akshatha many times, which went unanswered, she realized that she was missing.The police tried to trace her phone location, but it was constantly on move. During investigation the police found the couple used to fight often and they interrogated her husband, who confessed to the crime. The Sampangirama Nagar police contacted the Shoolagiri police and her description matched with the burnt body found in their limits. The police arrested both the accused.', 'ABU DHABI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a four-day visit to three West Asian countries, will on Sunday witness the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the first Hindu temple in the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

It is commonly used there and shown to be highly effective in treating general anxiety and well tolerated with limited adverse effects,” said Arnauld Belmer, a postdoctoral research student at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia.In the study, published in Scientific Reports, adult mice who underwent two weeks of daily treatment with the drug tandospirone saw a reduction in anxiety-like behaviors associated with alcohol withdrawal.Tandospirone reversed the effects of 15 weeks of binge-like alcohol consumption on neurogenesis — the ability of the brain to grow and replace neurons (brain cells).This was also accompanied by a significant decrease in binge-like alcohol intake.“This is a novel discovery that tandospirone can reverse the deficit in neurogenesis caused by alcohol,” said lead author Selena Bartlett, Professor at QUT.The study also opens the way to look at if neurogenesis is associated with other substance-abuse deficits, such as in memory and learning, and whether this compound can reverse these.“Tandospirone is not just another drug that shows promise in helping to reduce binge drinking,” Bartlett said.“While it could possibly have that effect, it might be able to help reboot the brain and reverse the deficits the alcohol abuse causes – both the inhibition to the brain’s ability to regenerate, and the behavioural consequences that come from what alcohol is doing to the brain, like increases in anxiety and depression,” she noted.', 'Cisco, Apple, Aon and Allianz announced a new cyber risk management solution for businesses, comprised of cyber resilience evaluation services from Aon, the most secure technology from Cisco and Apple, and options for cyber insurance coverage from Allianz.The new solution is designed to help a wider range of organisations better manage and protect themselves from the cyber risk associated with ransomware and other malware-related threats, which are the most common threats faced by organisations today. The cyber security risk is growing. Losses from cyber threats are outpacing investment in IT security. This fact, combined with the low adoption of cyber insurance, an active adversary, a fragmented security technology market and a security skills shortage, means it is difficult for many organisations to understand and manage this risk effectively.The new solution covers the primary dimensions of cyber protection for businesses. The key elements of the offering include:Cyber Resilience Evaluation:Aon cyber security professionals will assess interested customers’ cyber security posture and recommend ways to help improve their cyber security defences.Cyber Insurance:Allianz evaluated the Cisco and Apple technical foundation of the solution and determined that customers using Cisco Ransomware Defense, and/or qualified Apple products can be eligible for the Allianz-developed enhanced cyber insurance offering, acknowledging the level of security afforded to businesses by Cisco and Apple technology. This, in combination with individual risk insights gained through the Cyber Resilience Evaluation, makes possible the cyber insurance coverage to Cisco and Apple business customers. Enhancements include market-leading policy coverage terms and conditions, including potentially qualifying for lower, or even no, deductibles in certain cases. The cyber insurance coverage is underwritten by Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS).Cisco Ransomware Defense is part of Cisco’s integrated security portfolio that leverages threat intelligence from Cisco Talos to see threats once and block them everywhere. The solution includes advanced email security, next-generation endpoint protection and cloud-delivered malicious internet site blocking, to strengthen an organisation’s defences against malware, ransomware and other cyber threats.The tight integration of hardware, software and services on iOS devices ensures that each component of the system is trusted, from initial boot-up to installing third-party apps. Users benefit from always-on hardware encryption, as well as support for secure networking protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) and VPN out of the box.Oragnaisations will have access to Cisco and Aon’s Incident Response teams in the event of a malware attack. The new solution is available today.“At Cisco, security is foundational to everything we do. As the leading enterprise security company, we know that in a digital world security must come first, and our integrated security architecture reduces customers’ overall risk of exposure to ransomware and malware attacks,” said Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO, Cisco.“The choice of technology providers plays a critical role in any company’s defence against cyber attacks. That’s why, from the beginning, Apple has built products from the ground up with security in mind, and one of the many reasons why businesses around the world are choosing our products to power their enterprise,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.“Ransomware is an evolving risk that impacts every level of an enterprise. Oragnaisations urgently need to be managing these risks from both the technical and the financial perspective,” said Jason Hogg, CEO, Aon Cyber Solutions. “This holistic solution provides our clients with an integrated approach to addressing ransomware risk. We can provide customers with guidance on what cyber defences, resources and processes to deploy to improve their cyber posture. It’s the improved cyber posture that makes them eligible for enhanced/broader cyber insurance protection.”“Proactive analysis coupled with the latest technology creates an ideal defence against today’s ever-changing ransomware and malware attacks,” said Bill Scaldaferri, President and CEO, AGCS North America. “This strategic alliance with Aon, Apple and Cisco allows us to provide a unique solution to companies using this integrated platform to manage risk and ultimately strengthen their battle against high-profile threats.”', 'Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organisers confirmed that the Games had fallen victim to a cyber attack during Friday’s opening ceremony, but they refused to reveal the source.The Games’ systems, including the internet and television services, were affected by the hack two days ago but organisers said it had not compromised any critical part of their operations.“Maintaining secure operations is our purpose,” said International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesman Mark Adams. “We are not going to comment on the issue. It is one we are dealing with. We are making sure our systems are secure and they are secure.” Asked if organisers knew who was behind the attack, Adams said, “I certainly don’t know. But best international practice says that you don’t talk about an attack.”The Winter Games are being staged only 80km (50 miles) from the border with North Korea, which is technically still at war with the South since their 1950-1953 war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty.The two teams marched together at an Olympics opening ceremony for the first time since 2006. South Korea has been using the Pyeongchang Games to break the ice with the reclusive North, which has been trading nuclear threats with the United States recently.“All issues were resolved and recovered yesterday morning,” Pyeongchang organising committee spokesman Sung Baik-you said. “We know the cause of the problem but that kind of issues occurs frequently during the Games. We decided with the IOC we are not going to reveal the source (of the attack),” he said.Russia, which has been banned from the Games for doping, said days before the opening ceremony that any allegations linking Russian hackers to attacks on the infrastructure connected to the Pyeongchang Olympic Games were unfounded.“We know that Western media are planning pseudo-investigations on the theme of ‘Russian fingerprints’ in hacking attacks on information resources related to the hosting of the Winter Olympic Games in the Republic of Korea,” Russia’s foreign ministry said. “Of course, no evidence will be presented to the world.”Cybersecurity researchers said in January they had found early indications that Russia-based hackers may be planning attacks against anti-doping and Olympic organisations in retaliation for Russia’s exclusion from the Pyeongchang Games.Stakeholders of the Olympics have been wary of the threat from hacking and some sponsors have taken out insurance to protect themselves from a cyber attack.', 'New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday asked markets regulator Sebi to take more steps to deepen the corporate bond market and hoped that continuing uptrend in IPOs will help in meeting the disinvestment targets.The board of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Saturday apprised Jaitley about the market trends and recent initiatives taken by it. Jaitley addressed the market regulator’s board in a customary post-Budget exercise. Talking to reporters, Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi said the finance minister was of the view that the regulator should focus on deepening the corporate bond market and more IPOs to help meet the disinvestment targets as well as monetisation of assets through InVITs.“We have apprised the finance minister about what are our priorities and what we have been doing in the (past) one year,” he said. He added that Jaitley appreciated the initiatives taken by the markets regulator.“I think more than Sebi, capital markets… have been really doing well globally,” Tyagi said.The board also discussed the implementation of the Budget announcements related to Sebi.Later, while addressing RBI’s board, Jaitley said: “I had a meeting with Sebi board and one of the factors that stood out from the regulator’s presentation is that there is an increased reliance on corporate bonds as far as credit is concerned.”Besides Jaitley, the Sebi board meeting was attended by Minister of State for Finance Pon Radhakrishnan, Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian, Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas, Sebi’s board members G Mahalingam, Arun P Sathe and Madhabi Puri Buch and other senior officials of the markets regulator.  ', 'Tata has started developing new products based on its two new platforms codenamed the Alpha and Omega. The Alpha platform will form the basis of a future sedan from Tata. The Alpha platform, which was previously known as the AMP (Advanced Modular Platform), underpins the 45X concept showcased at the Auto Expo 2018. The production version of this premium hatchback will be positioned above the Tiago and will compete against the Maruti Suzuki Baleno and the refreshed Hyundai Elite i20.This platform will also underpin future Tata cars that will compete for market share right from the entry-level segment to mid-size sedans and SUVs as big as the Toyota Corolla Altis and the Hyundai Tucson. Tata’s lead designer, Pratap Bose, confirmed this in an exclusive chat. He told us, “We have AMP for all future cars ranging from 3.8 metres to 4.4 metres, while larger cars ranging between 4.5 metres to 4.8 metres will be based on the Q platform. These two platforms will cover every segment that the Indian four-wheeler industry has to offer.” He added that the 45X is going to be the first product from the 45 Series leading us to believe that there will soon be more models based on this hatchback in the near future.Alongside the 45X, Tata Motors displayed an outline of three products with different body styles which are likely to be based on this platform. One of the outline suggests that a sedan that looks more like a coupe is in the pipeline. The new sedan will benefit from Tata’s new Impact 2.0 design language, which is a more evolved version of the existing design theme seen in cars such as the Nexon, Hexa and the Tiago-Tigor twins. And going by the H5X and the 45X, we can expect the sedan to feature a sharp and modern styling.The sedan could share the Nexon’s turbocharged petrol and diesel engines, both of which make 110PS of maximum power and are mated to a 6-speed manual transmission.Like the 45X, which is a premium hatchback that will compete with the likes of the Volkswagen Polo and Honda Jazz, its sedan sibling will rival their sedan siblings, the Volkswagen Vento and the Honda City.', 'Maruti Suzuki has launched the third-gen Swift in India with prices starting at Rs 4.99 lakh (Swift launch report). With the update, it seems like the carmaker is looking to further strengthen its presence in the segment. Let’s find out how the new Swift fares against its competition and whether it has what it takes to remain at the top its category.      Starting off with the dimensions, the new Swift is the tallest and widest hatchback in its segment. It also has the longest wheelbase among the three. The Swift’s’ wider and taller construction makes it a more spacious car than before. When it comes to luggage carrying capacity, the Swift remains the leader while the other two get an almost identical boot space. With a ground clearance of 174mm, the Figo is best equipped among the lot to take on tall speed breakers and deep ruts that our roads are known for. The Grand i10 comes second with 165mm followed by the Swift at 163mm.The Figo gets the largest capacity engine of the three. The 1.5-litre unit is also the most powerful one here. The other two cars get engines with identical power and torque output. Amongst the three, only the Swift gets the option of an AMT gearbox alongside the 5-speed manual which comes as standard on all three cars. On the fuel economy front, the Swift is the most efficient one.Likewise, the petrol Figo is the most powerful car in this comparison. The other two cars have identical power and torque figures. However, this time around, all three cars are offered with automatic transmission, albeit different technologies. While the Figo automatic gets a more advance dual-clutch gearbox, which is offered only with the 1.5-litre petrol engine, the Grand i10 gets an old-school 4-speed torque converter. The Swift, be it in manual or automatic guise, continues to be the most fuel efficient one in this comparison as well.When it comes to pricing, the Grand i10 is the most affordable car of the lot with a starting price of Rs 4.59 lakh, about Rs 40,000 lower than both the Swift and Figo’s base price. But the Grand i10 gets basic safety features like ABS and airbags in higher variants only, which is where it lacks a bit.The Ford Figo is also priced at par with these cars but feels a bit dated now considering the features and interior design. If you prioritise performance over features though, the Ford Figo diesel makes for a good choice too.The Swift could be the car for you if you are looking for a set of wheels which is high on space while being fun to drive and supported by a wide after sales support that only Maruti Suzuki can boast of. Overall, the Swift looks like a better package than the other two. We’re waiting to get our hands on the Swift to do an extensive comparo with its competitors.', 'New Delhi: Megastar Amitabh Bachchan and Bollywood ‘Queen’ Kangana Ranaut would soon be co-stars. If reports are to be believed, filmmaker R Balki has apparently approached Kangana to play an amputee, ‘who reclaims her life after a freak accident’ with the help of her mentor. Big B has been approached to play the role of her mentor in the movie.

According to the members, the film deals with ‘taboo’ subjects such as menstruation and thus, cannot be allowed to screen in Pakistan. Furthermore, the Federal Censor Board announced a ban on the film in all cinemas across the country. “We can’t allow our film distributors to import films which are against our traditions and culture,” FCB member Ishaq Ahmed was quoted as saying by PTI. The members of Punjab Film Censor Board also refused to watch the film saying it is based on a “taboo subject” and outrightly rejected any clearance certificate to it. “We can’t allow the screening of films on taboo subjects in our cinemas as it is not in our culture, society or even religion,” a member said.Well-known Pakistani filmmaker Syed Noor said that there was a need to speak to the local film distributors and exhibitors about the films they import from other countries. “Not only this film ‘Padman’ but I think even ‘Padmaavat’ should not have been released in Pakistan as it portrays Muslims in a very negative light,” Noor said.Directed by R Balki, the film also stars Radhika Apte and Sonam Kapoor in pivotal roles. The movie has opened to a good reception in India as it earned Rs 10.26 crore on its first day and is expected to cross the Rs 50 crore mark during the weekend.

The Mahindra G4 Rexton , which has made its official debut at the Auto Expo 2018, will soon become the most expensive SUV you can buy from the homegrown automaker. It is technically the second-gen SsangYong Rexton, but will be marketed under Mahindra’s label in its second innings in the country.Compared to the outgoing Rexton, the new SUV is based on a brand new platform. However, it continues to be a body-on-frame offering like most of the other SUVs in this segment.

As the men, seemingly drunk, beat him, a passerby stopped for a while, but others seemed to not notice anything.The men, who recorded the crime, are heard saying, “The police will turn up only after he is dead”. However, neither makes a call to inform the police about the incident.A man in brown leather jacket who appears to be with the accused is seen in the video trying to push and shove the attackers to stop them, but fails. He, along with a few others, later drove away with Dilip on a motorcycle.Based on the video, the main accused has been identified, but no arrests have been made so far.The police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) based on a complaint filed by Dilip’s brother.According to the police, Dilip, who lived in a rented house in Allahabad, had gone out for dinner with two friends. They reportedly had an argument with the attackers which soon turned violent. Dilip’s friends managed to escape.“We had gone for dinner at Kalika restaurant. After dinner, we were sitting on the stairs that lead to the restaurant. Three people came, pushed us, abused and went to the restaurant on the first floor. We followed them to the restaurant to confront them which is when they started beating us. I was hit with chairs too, but I managed to escape,” said Prakash Singh, one of Dilip’s friends and an eyewitness in the case, according to a report in NDTV.

But his comments about Israel mark rare criticism from a president who has publicly sparred with the Palestinians while forging warm ties with Israel ahead of the expected presentation of a US peace outline. “Right now, I would say the Palestinians are not looking to make peace. And I am not necessarily sure that Israel is looking to make peace. So we are just going to have to see what happens,” Trump was quoted as saying. He did not disclose details about the anticipated peace plan.Israel Hayom is owned by American billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a Trump backer and a supporter of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. In the interview, Trump criticised Israel’s West Bank settlements, which the Palestinians and most of the international community view as illegal obstacles to peace. The Trump White House has been less publicly critical of Israel’s settlement building than previous administrations.“The settlements are something that very much complicates and always have complicated making peace, so I think Israel has to be very careful with the settlements,” he said. Relations between the US and the Palestinians have spiralled since Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December.', 'Congress president Rahul Gandhi has hit out at Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat over the latter’s comment on the Sangh having the capability to form an Army in three days.

Doctors believe that a snail egg must have found its way into the wound, hatched and then grew, triggering an abscess – a painful collection of pus caused by an infection – before it was removed.The team of doctors at the Loma Linda University’s pediatrics department was highly intrigued after they stumbled across the bizarre case and published it in the journal BMJ Case Reports.According to a report in the Daily Mail, the doctors said: ‘An extensive literature review of major medical and scientific databases… was performed.‘We found no documented case reports in medical literature of… marine snails living inside a bacterial skin abscess for any length of time.’In 2013, a similar case of a four-year-old boy was documented, who also had a snail hatch inside him.As per the Daily Mail, Paul Franklin picked up the tiny crustacean he later nicknamed ‘Turbo’ when he grazed his knee while falling on the rocks during a holiday.However, doctors never mentioned it in any medical journal, despite the case making headlines, for unknown reasons.Highlighting the similarities between the two cases, doctors suggested that the possibility of the snail entering the body, in the same way, was high.In the present case, the 11-year-old Hispanic boy visited an outpatient clinic with a ‘blister’ on his left elbow.A week after he got the lesion, the boy noticed it had slowly been growing in size and he became concerned.On questioning, the boy explained that he had been exploring tide pools San Pedro – seven miles (11km) away from Long Beach – when he slipped on a rock and grazed his elbow.While his symptoms – no pain and no itching – indicated that it was clearly an infection, doctors, after closer inspection, decided to drain the pus on the boy’s elbow using a sterile needle.They removed a small amount of pus – but were shocked to discover a ‘small, darkly colored foreign body’.A sea snail and its shell, measuring 4mm in diameter, were removed from the lump. It was then sent for tests to confirm its identity.Dr Albert Khait, who published the case, revealed they dished out antibiotics to the boy and his wound had fully healed a week later.Doctors said the boy’s abscess was a ‘hostile environment’ for a snail because of its ability to seal moisture within its shell, which is why it survived.Most skin abscesses are caused by harmless bacteria that humans carry on their skin, but occasionally can be triggered, more unusual, ways.A slight graze, like what the boy endured after falling on the rocks, can ‘open the door’ to parasites or opportunistic organisms, such as a tiny snail.The chequered periwinkle, found along the western coast of the US, Mexico, and Canada, can grow up to 15mm in diameter.Paediatricians in Los Angeles allowed the ‘visibly excited’ boy to keep the snail when it was removed so he could share his tale with his friends.', 'Terror threat looms over Shiva temples across the country on the Maha Shivaratri day. According to sources in intelligence agencies, an alert has been issued in this regard to several states, warning that terrorists may target temples where devotees converge in large numbers for Maha Shivaratri.Sources also said that the terrorists are likely to specifically target Jyotirlinga temples.In the wake of the intelligence alert, the Maharashtra Police is taking stock of the security at Trimbakeshwar temple in Nashik, which is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga temples in India.According to sources, alerts have also been issued for temples in Punjab, Haryana, Jammu, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttarakhand.Maha Shivaratri dedicated to Lord Shiva is one of the most significant Hindu festivals and is celebrated by his devotees across the globe.

', 'When Nagaland goes to the polls on February 27, former Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio would have no reason to worry about retaining his seat. He has already been declared the winner from the Northern Angami-II seat. Rio’s unopposed victory came after his rival from the Naga People’s Front (NPF) withdrew his nomination.Rio had quit the NPF last month and joined the newly-formed Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). The NDPP is a BJP ally. He is in the running for a fourth term as Nagaland Chief Minister.“The NPF candidate withdrew his nomination today, and the only other candidate of the NDPP was declared winner,” Nagaland’s Chief Electoral Officer Abhijit Sinha said on Monday.Rio’s only opponent for the Northern Angami-II was NPF’s Chupfuo Angami, who happens to be Rio’s brother-in-law. Angami said he had quit the race because “his position was not good”, reports said.This is not the first time that Rio will enter the Nagaland Assembly without a challenge. In 1998, he had been elected unopposed as a Congress candidate, thanks to boycott of the election by other parties. Rio is presently the Member of Parliament for Nagaland, the only seat the state has in the Lok Sabha. He had won the seat in 2014 as an NPF candidate. In the event of a victory for his party, Rio would have to resign his Lok Sabha seat to be able to continue as a Nagaland MLA, and possibly Chief Minister.Rio has served three terms spanning 11 years as Chief Minister of Nagaland, from 2003 to 2014. He had passed on the CM’s office to TR Zeliang after winning the Lok Sabha seat. Rio had quit the NPF, which he had co-founded, after the party leadership decided to break its alliance with the BJP.Nagaland goes to the polls on February 27.

Harmanpreet will be assisted by in-form batswoman Smriti Mandhana.India would also be bolstered by the inclusion of T20 specialist Anuja Patil and debutant all-rounder Radha Yadav and wicketkeeper Nuzhat Parveen in the squad.The T20 squad also features 17-year-old Mumbai player Jemimah Rodrigues, who had grabbed headlines after scoring 202 in 163 balls in an Under-19 game.After a rare failure in last ODI, the Indians would be relying heavily on Mandhana to provide a solid start to the innings.Deepti Sharma and Veda Krishnamurthy, who made 79 and 56 respectively in a losing cause in the last match, would be hoping to carry on their good form in the shortest format.India’s success also relies heavily on skipper Harmanpreet and Mithali Raj’s contributions.On the bowling front, veteran Jhulan Goswami is expected to return to the playing eleven after being rested for the third ODI.In Jhulan’s absence, the Indian bowling attack lacked sting in the last match as Mignon du Preez scored a valiant 90 to pull off a consolation win for South Africa.Du Preez was ably assisted by opener Laura Wolvaardt (59) as the duo laid the foundation for a successful run chase.Among the South African bowlers, left-arm pacer Shabnim Ismail would look to carry on her impressive form.She did the maximum damage to India in the last ODI picking up four wickets while conceding just 30 runs from her nine overs.Teams (from):India: Harmanpreet Kaur (captain), Smriti Mandhana (vice-captain), Mithali Raj, Veda Krishnamurthy, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Anuja Patil, Taniya Bhatia, Nuzhat Parveen Poonam Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Jhulan Goswami, Shikha Pandey, Pooja Vastrakar, Radha Yadav.South Africa: Dane van Niekerk (captain), Marizanne Kapp, Trisha Chetty, Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka, Masabata Klaas, Sune Luus, Odine Kirsten, Mignon du Preez, Lizelle Lee, Chloe Tryon, Nadine de Klerk, Raisibe Ntozakhe, Moseline Daniels.', 'Chelsea manager Antonio Conte believes he needs to be more persuasive when asking the club to sign new players, saying that his efforts to convince his board to spend big in the transfer window were “a bit of a disaster”.Conte led Chelsea to the Premier League title last season, but their failure to replicate last season`s form has led to questions about the size and quality of the squad, with the side in fifth on 50 points, 22 behind leaders Manchester City.The club also either failed to splurge in the recent transfer market or lost out on players they were interested in and while the Italian said he felt he could still get the best out of his squad, there was a need for fresh blood.“My task is to try and improve every single player, in every aspect. In terms of their mentality also… for this, I`m very good,” Conte was quoted as saying by British media.“But I think I`m a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy players. I think in this aspect I can improve a lot.“I have to learn a lot from the other coaches, the other managers, in that aspect. I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good at persuading their clubs to spend money to buy top players.”Striker Alexis Sanchez and defender Virgil van Dijk were among the players linked to Chelsea in January, but they went to Manchester United and Liverpool respectively.Chelsea have since suffered league defeats to Bournemouth and Watford since the transfer window closed, leading to media speculation about Conte`s future.The 48-year-old, however, is confident the reports would not hinder his players` performances, with Chelsea hosting bottom side West Bromwich Albion later on Monday.“Honestly I don`t think talk about my future can affect the players,” he added.“I think my players are getting used to these rumours, to this speculation, but for sure I am very happy with the commitment of my players, the behaviour of my players because they show me every day they want to overcome this situation.” ', 'Pune-based swimmer, Rohan More became the first Asian as well as the first Indian to swim across the Ocean Seven.Rohan is the youngest person in the world to swim across the Ocean Seven. The Ocean`s Seven marathon consists of seven long-distance open-water swims, which includes the North Channel, the Cook Strait, the Molokai Channel, the English Channel, the Catalina Channel, the Tsugaru Strait and the Strait of Gibraltar.The swimming marathon is widely considered equivalent to the Seven Summits mountaineering challenge.With this, More becomes only the ninth person in the world to complete it. After waiting for a long time, due to bad weather conditions, Rohan got the chance to swim on February 9. He began swimming at about 9:30 a.m. from the North Island.For the first five hours, the water was calm and the temperature was around 19 degrees Celsius. However, as he progressed towards the South Island, the water temperature dropped by about four degrees Celsius, due to currents from the Antarctic water.He fought bravely against the cold water and strong Antarctic currents to complete the swim in eight hours 37 minutes.Talking about his achievement, More said, “It is the greatest moment of my life as I swam across Cook Strait in New Zealand which was the seventh and last in the Ocean Seven.“I really feel very proud and emotional about this thing because after swimming this challenge I became the first Indian ever in history to complete this challenge and only ninth person in the world who has swum all the seven challenges in the Ocean Seven,” he added.The swimmer also thanked his family members and friends for their support which helped him achieve this feat.

Here are their tweets:Magic happens when creative women come together. Excited to collaborate with Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari.

Looking forward for this beautiful world of storytelling to evolve as @ektaravikapoor and I get our creative forces together for the pure love of cinema. Gratitude  https://t.co/2l6rkQWwct— Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (@Ashwinyiyer) February 12, 2018The two will produce a coming-of-age comedy of a married couple and a lighthearted comedy. What’s more in store? Ashwiny will be directing one of the movies.Talking about it, Ekta told The Times Of India, “I had seen ‘Nil Battey Sannata’ and had messaged her appreciating it. Next, we met on a Chennai-bound flight, sitting one behind the other, where we roughly chalked out a plan to work together. Eventually, after months of exchanges, we’re here. We get along really well. Our sensibilities work beautifully, in tandem with each other. There’s so much depth to every scene, every character she creates. When you have new talent, you mentor, but when you have a talent like Ashwiny, you ally with her because she brings something distinct to the table.”Whereas Ashwiny exclaimed, “In these months that we have been interacting, Ekta has always given me my space and she understands me well. There is nothing corporate about our equation. We didn’t join hands saying that, ‘Come, let’s make a blockbuster’. She keeps everything simple. She also understands human behaviour and has amazing insights about the psyche of the Indian audience. Stories, scripts and films are all about people, which she understands well. It doesn’t matter what the future professionally holds for both of us, but this relationship that I share with her today will last a lifetime.”While Ekta Kapoor has mostly ventured into adult content, Ashwiny has kept her films such that they have a universal appeal. It will definitely be interesting to see what both of them have to offer to their audiences combined.', 'New Delhi: Elli AvrRam, who has been making headlines for her closeness to Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya, has broken her silence on the rumoured link-up. During an interview with the Hindustan Times, the ‘Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon’ actress spoke about her rumoured relationship with Hardik, while smartly staying away from giving away the answer.“Let them be curious in life. Why do I need to clarify anything? By talking about these rumours, I’d just be giving more fodder for gossip. Anyway, so many wrong things have been written over the years but I’ve never gone out and clarified,” Elli told the daily.“Once you become a known face, people will follow you for gossip and news. But, we are not going to lock ourselves up. So, you can’t do much to stop these rumours,” she said.When asked to be more specific, Elli maintained that she doesn’t want to talk about her personal life and said that people will never believe her irrespective of what she says. “People have such strong mentality that no matter what I say [about Hardik], they will be like, ‘Oh, she is lying. We know the truth. She is hiding something,” she said. The actress concluded by saying that she is only answerable to her family and keep them updated about everything which is happening in her life. The buzz about the two started doing the rounds after the former Bigg Boss contestant was spotted attending Hardik’s brother Krunal Pandya’s wedding ceremonies. She was later spotted at a party organised by Shikhar Dhawan’s wife Aaesha. Despite several speculations being made about the two dating each other, Ellie has always preferred to remain tight-lipped about it. In fact, she has neither accepted nor denied the link-up.

The plea was filed by NGO Swaraj Abhiyan seeking probe into the purchase of the VVIP choppers in 2006-07 and the foreign bank accounts purportedly linked to the son of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh.The plea was dismissed by the division bench of Justice AK Goel and Justice UU Lalit, saying they did not find any merit in it. Hearing the arguments into the plea, the court had earlier said that it was concerned whether any “fraud” was committed while purchasing a VIP AgustaWestland helicopter. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the NGO, had said that a proposal of the state in December 2006 stated that there should be open bid to purchase the helicopter. It said that helicopter firms should be invited but no company was called and a tender was issued only for AgustaWestland. He had also told the court that the documents received under the RTI showed that although the Bell helicopter was denied a bid, the government was still hiring it on rent.However, the Chhattisgarh government had said court that there was nothing wrong in the bid and that at present 24 AgustaWestland helicopters were flying in the country.

Islamabad further endorsed the United Nations’ list of banned terrorist organisations by barring them in Pakistan as well.The move spells bad news for several terror entities such as Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), Lashkar-e-Toiba and Harkat-ul Mujahideen, which are among the 27 banned outfits on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) list. The amended Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) ordinance, which goes into effect immediately, will see the assets of the banned organisations frozen.The ordinance, pushed by President Mamnoon Hussain last Friday, was made public on Monday evening.“President Mamnoon Hussain last Friday quietly promulgated an ordinance amending the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 with regards to proscription of terrorist individuals and organisations to include entities listed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) — in a move that would end a longstanding ambiguity over the status of Hafiz Saeed-linked Jamaatud Dawa and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) by firmly placing them on the list of proscribed groups,” said Pakistani daily Dawn.The development comes just days before a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meeting is scheduled to take place in Paris.“It was feared that FATF, under pressure from the US and India, would place Pakistan on its grey list, which in turn could raise the cost of doing international financial transactions for Pakistan,” reported Dawn.On Monday, US President Donald Trump proposed a $256-million in civilian assistance and $80-million in military aid to Pakistan while unveiling the $4-trillion annual budget for the fiscal 2019 beginning October 1.Earlier in January 2018, US President Donald Trump froze a $ 2 billion military aid to Pakistan for its inability to act on terror outfits on home soil.

The board on Friday endorsed that decision and announced an investigation into the allegations, saying it would determine the co-chairman’s future with the company.But the Weinstein Co. board, which includes Weinstein’s brother, went further on Sunday, firing the executive who has always been its primary operator, public face and studio chief. Under his leadership, the Weinstein Co. has been a dominant force at the Oscars, including the rare feat of winning back-to-back best picture Academy Awards with “The King’s Speech” and “The Artist.” In recent years, however, Weinstein’s status has diminished because of money shortages, disappointing box-office returns and executive departures.An attorney for Weinstein didn’t immediately return messages Sunday.A spokesperson for The Weinstein Co. declined to provide further details on Weinstein’s firing. Messages left for attorney John Keirnan of the firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, who had been appointed to lead an investigation, weren’t immediately returned Sunday.Weinstein on Thursday issued a lengthy statement that acknowledged causing “a lot of pain.” He also asked for “a second chance.” But Weinstein and his lawyers also criticized The New York Times’ report in statements and interviews, and vowed an aggressive response.

If seedings hold up, that means he would have to defeat compatriot and friend Stan Wawrinka in what would be a high-profile quarter-final. “I would love to be in that position with anyone, but with Stan it would be like a Grand Slam final, a big-time match,” said Federer, fresh from winning a 20th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.“I’m hoping to get to number one and hoping to do it this week. You always want to do it the tough way, it’s not easy to get there.“The achievement would be quite incredible. It’s exciting to see Stan in my section and it’s great to have him back (after knee surgery in July).”Federer made a relatively late decision to play at the event, which he won in 2005 and 2012.He said that after winning in Melbourne a fortnight ago, he felt good enough to compete this week and is also considering playing in Dubai in two weeks’ time.“I didn’t expect to win Australia, I played it not thinking about number one,” he said. “I didn’t think of the rankings at all in Melbourne. Afterwards, I thought I could always play Rotterdam, I’d love to play, give it a go and see what happens.“I’m happy I’m here, healthy and eager to play,” he said. He starts his bid on Wednesday against Belgian Ruben Bemelmans.Federer also gave some insight into his plans for the spring claycourt season, which he skipped completely last year on the way to winning his eighth Wimbledon title.“The clay season is up in the air. If I’m playing a lot during this part of the season, it would be hard to play a robust clay season.“It would be light (schedule) if I do play,” he said. “We’ll see how it goes, I’m healthy and glad to be playing. I should be playing when I feel that way and not play when I don’t feel at 100 percent or don’t feel ready to do it.“That’s the secret for me moving forward.” Play got underway on Monday, with third seed Alexander Zverev seeing off Spanish veteran David Ferrer 6-4, 6-3.It was the 20-year-old German’s first win over the former French Open finalist at the third attempt.Former Rotterdam winner Tomas Berdych put out Zverev’s older brother Mischa 7-5, 6-3, while Spain’s Feliciano Lopez eliminated 2016 champion Martin Klizan 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).“I am very happy with this win,” Lopez said. “It is good to beat a former champion.

DFID (the Department for International Development) have taken action in this area to try and further strengthen systems to enforce a zero tolerance approach. There are a number of measures they have taken but we want to go further in this area,” he said', \"Beijing: Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, already under fire for overseeing a state-sanctioned blood bath, has reached a new level in a series of misogynistic and violent remarks, wherein he has encouraged the country’s armed forces to ‘shoot female rebels in their vaginas’.Duterte made the comment on February 7th while addressing the Armed Forces of Philippines (AFP), who were formerly a group of communists, the Washington Post reported. “The Presidential Communications Office included the comment in the official transcript from the event, but replaced the word ‘vagina’ with a dash.”“Tell the soldiers. ‘There’s a new order coming from the mayor. We won’t kill you. We will just shoot your vagina,'” he said.Duterte then took it further adding that, “If there is no vagina, it would be useless,” indicating — as typical patriarchal fascists do — that women are worthless without their genitals.Duterte who came into power after vouching to kill all of the country’s drug users and peddlers has been doing just that. The shocking numbers of Filipinos that have lost their lives, and arbitrarily so, has urged the international criminal court to open investigations into Duterte’s role in sanctioning state-sponsored violence.This is not the first time that Duterte has come under the limelight for being openly misogynistic and tried to brush it away ‘as a joke’. Not too long ago, Duterte’s spokesman accused women of ‘overreacting’ and urged them to laugh off the president’s denigrating comments.“According to the official transcript the event, the crowd did, in fact, laugh.”He has in the past ‘joked’ about rape and targeted female politicians with unsolicited comments about their sexuality.“Duterte (sic) latest nasty remark openly encourages violence against women, contributes to the impunity on such, and further confirms himself as the most dangerous macho-fascist in the government right now,” said a representative for Gabriela, a feminist organization, in a statement.“He is pushing the fascist AFP to commit more bloody human rights violations and grave abuses of international humanitarian law, and takes state terrorism against women and the people to a whole new level.”\", 'Yangon: For four straight days in January, Rahim Muddinn watched, amazed, as Myanmar’s state-run newspapers published special supplements showing Rohingya Muslims accused of being terrorists nearly 250 photos each day.For the 41-year-old Rohingya man, it was a surreal moment. He was born and raised in Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city and far from the western state of Rakhine, where bloody military operations that followed Rohingya militant attacks in August have driven nearly 700,000 Rohingya into refugee camps in Bangladesh.“When we first saw those pictures, we started laughing. We wondered: When will it be our turn to have our pictures in the paper?” Muddinn, a teacher, said in an interview in his Yangon home.Behind the laughter, though, there is genuine fear.The pictures are the latest in a series of chilling realizations for the Rohingya minority here.Though Yangon’s tree-lined boulevards and weathered colonial architecture seem a world away from the rice paddies and isolated villages of Rakhine let alone the tarp-walled huts of the teeming refugee camps the government is increasingly linking Rohingya across the country with what it calls a terrorist threat, Muddinn and others say.Rohingya in Yangon describe a sense of rising persecution and hatred, of vanishing freedoms and opportunities, of Buddhist neighbours and friends suddenly more willing to publicly express sympathies with the military’s destruction of Rohingya villages in Rakhine.Also Read: Discovery of Rohingya mass graves has US ‘deeply, deeply troubled’“One day it really could be my picture in the paper,” said Muddinn. Like most of the other Rohingya who spoke with The Associated Press, he used his Rohingya name because of safety worries. “I do have anxiety. The government can detain anyone it says is a supporter of terrorism or anyone viewed as a threat to the state.”Though Rohingya have always been persecuted in the country, it got much worse after 2012, when violence in Rakhine killed hundreds and drove about 140,000 people, most of them Rohingya, from their homes to camps.Violence flared again in 2016 and, most dramatically, following the August attacks, when refugees report widespread killing and rape by Myanmar forces.The AP in January confirmed, through extensive interviews with survivors and time-stamped video, a massacre and at least five mass graves, all previously unreported, in the Rakhine village of Gu Dar Pyin.Many Rohingya have been in Myanmar for generations, but, increasingly, the government and media have played up their claim that they’re not citizens but “illegal Bengali interlopers” who entered Myanmar from Bangladesh with the help of corrupt immigration officers.There are non-Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, and they often report rising discrimination, especially those in Rakhine. But generally their situation is less precarious than the Rohingya.Myanmar’s government denies discriminating against Rohingya and other Muslims.', 'Hyderabad: Special Operations Team of Rachakonda police Malkajgiri zone busted a city-bound ganja racket and nabbed two persons.

A decision on allowing the movement of traffic on the highway will be taken only after the road is cleared off by the road maintenance agency,” the official said.The highway? the only all-weather road link connecting the Kashmir Valley with the rest of the country – was closed for traffic on Monday as Kashmir experienced the seasons?s first major snowfall.\\nMeanwhile, the weather stayed dry, but cloudy across Kashmir last night and the MeT office said there will be an improvement today.\\nSrinagar recorded a minimum of zero degrees Celsius, an official of the MeT Office here said.He said Qazigund town in south Kashmir recorded a low of -3.6 degrees Celsius, while the nearby Kokernag town registered a low of -3. 9 degrees Celsius.Kupwara town in north Kashmir had a low of 0.2 degree Celsius, he said.Pahalgam, the south Kashmir resort which also serves as one of the base camps for the annual Amarnath Yatra, registered?a minimum of -8.2 degrees Celsius, the official said.Leh town in the Ladakh region quivered at -10.8 degrees Celsius, while the nearby Kargil town braved cold at -10 degrees Celsius.Leh was the coldest recorded place in Jammu and Kashmir, the official said.', 'Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala government, on Wednesday, announced a hike in government and private bus fares that will come into effect from March 1.The minimum fare for an ordinary bus service will be Rs 8, up from Rs 7, and for fast passenger services, the fare will be Rs 11 instead of Rs 10. Along with the minimum fare, charges per kilometer for all category of services have also been raised. The hike ranges between eight paise and Rs 6.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan took the decisions at a cabinet meeting in Thiruvananthapuram.Talking to reporters, transport minister AK Saseendran said the hike was necessary to sustain the transport sector.The bus fares were last revised in 2014.“The government is not happy taking such a decision,” he said.Speaking on the revision of concessional fares for students, Saseendran said there would be a marginal increase of Re 1 for students travelling up to 40 kms.The announcement was made on the basis of the recommendations of Justice C Ramachandran panel that went into the problems faced by the transport industry, a release from the Chief Minister’s office said.The Congress-led UDF opposition slammed the LDF government’s move, saying the state government was putting more burden on the people who were already suffering due to steep raise in price of essential commodities.“This hike could have been avoided if the government had decided to go away with the additional income it received through increase in price petroleum products,” Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala said.', 'Washington: America’s intelligence chief has warned that Pakistan-supported terrorist groups would continue to carry out attacks inside India, thus risking escalation of tension between the two neighbours.Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats’ remarks came days after a group of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists struck the Sunjuwan Military Camp in Jammu on Saturday, killing seven people including six soldiers.Pakistan, in fact, will continue to threaten US interests by deploying new nuclear weapons capabilities, maintaining its ties to terrorists, restricting counter- terrorism cooperation, and drawing closer to China, Coats said in his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Tuesday.“Militant groups supported by Islamabad will continue to take advantage of their safe haven in Pakistan to plan and conduct attacks in India and Afghanistan, including against US interests,” Coats said during the hearing on ‘Worldwide Threat Assessment’ of the US intelligence community.He said Pakistan’s perception of its eroding position relative to India, reinforced by endemic economic weakness and domestic security issues, almost certainly will exacerbate long-held fears of isolation and drive Islamabad’s pursuit of actions that run counter to US goals for the region.Without specifically referring to any terrorist incident by Pakistan-based groups, Coats told the lawmakers that he expects tension between the two Asian neighbours.“Relations between India and Pakistan are likely to remain tense, with continued violence on the Line of Control and the risk of escalation if there is another high-profile terrorist attack in India or an uptick in violence on the Line of Control,” Coats said. ', 'New Delhi: “Don’t communalise martyrs,” was Northern Command chief General Devraj Anbu’s crisp and on-point answer to politician Asaduddin Owaisi pointing out on Tuesday that five out of seven soldiers killed in the recent attacks in Kashmir were Muslims.Anbu also said that those making communal statements over the death of soldiers obviously did not know the army very well. Owaisi’s comment was targetted at those ‘questioning the loyalty of Indian Muslims’.He said that their point was way off base and as an example he brought up the event of the recent deaths in Jammu and Kashmir.“Those who call Indian Muslims Pakistani should learn something from this. We (Muslims) are sacrificing our lives (for the country),” said Owaisi.Four of the six Army men, Mohammad Ashraf Mir, Habibullah Qureshi, Manzoor Ahmed Deva and Mohammad Iqbal Sheikh, killed in the attack were identified as Kashmiris. One civilian, Ghulam Mohiuddin Sheikh, the father of one of the slain Army men, was also among the total seven people killed.Thousands of people defied threats and turned up to pay their respects on Tuesday to the deceased Kashmiri soldiers.A huge crowd also gathered to pay last respect to Iqbal Sheikh and his father Mohiuddin Sheikh at Reshipora village of South Kashmir’s Tral region.“They never hurt anyone,” said one of the neighbours about the father-son duo.Similar scenes were witnessed at Kewa village in Anantnag district and in North Kashmir’s Lolab, where the bodies of Manzoor Ahmad Deva and Mohammed Ashraf Mir reached for the last rites respectively.Separately in the east of the country, in Bihar, thousands also showed up to pay tribute to CRPF jawan Mujahid Khan in Arrah.He lost his life in an encounter with terrorists in Karan Nagar in Srinagar on Tuesday.', 'MUMBAI: State-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) said on Wednesday it had detected some “fraudulent and unauthorised” transactions worth about $1.77 billion at one of its branches in Mumbai.

The insurance offers travelers benefits like coverage for 75 minutes of flight delay, loss of checked-in baggage, and paperless claims, amongst other benefits.Committed to making claims simple and seamless, Digit has introduced a two-step paperless claims process.For instance, if a flight is delayed, the customers receive an SMS, they click a photograph of their boarding pass and get the credit in their account of choice, instantly.“We wanted to increase the relevance of the domestic travel insurance product and hence designed benefits that customers can actually experience. For instance, customers know they are covered for flight delays but don’t know the condition of a six hours delay, which rarely happens. Or that they can claim if they lose their baggage but aren’t aware that they must furnish bills of the items inside their baggage for that. We have turned all these perceived benefits into actual ones,” said Digit chief distribution officer, Jasleen Kohli.“We have tried to eliminate the friction at the time of claims through our paperless process. And we have already sold more than 15,000 policies within six weeks of launch,” Kohli added.“It is refreshing to work with a partner who uses data to analyse trends and create the most useful travel product that’s out in the market. The approach goes one step further by enabling a seamless claims process that makes the customer claim journey frictionless. For the first time Cleartrip and Digit offer a travel insurance product that offers meaningful coverage and the claim ratio stands testament to the customer benefits,” said Cleartrip chief product officer, Subramanya Sharma.The product features include a personal accident cover of upto Rs 10 lakh for accidental death and disability, and a benefit of upto Rs 2 lakh for emergency accidental treatment.It also provides a benefit of upto Rs 20,000 on trip cancellation due to personal emergency and a benefit of Rs 3,000 on missed connection due to a delay in the previous flight.Moreover, one can claim a benefit of Rs 2000, if the arrival of their checked-in bag is delayed by more than two hours. Most of the travel products in the market, offer this for a delay of more than six hours, which is rare.One can also avail a benefit of Rs 10,000 on the total loss of checked-in baggage.What’s more? A flight delay for a minimum of 75 minutes comes with a benefit of Rs 1,000. One can avail an instant credit in this case.', 'Greater Noida: Domestic passenger vehicle sales grew by 7.57 per cent to 2,85,477 units in January this year, riding on a robust growth of utility vehicles which posted the second highest ever monthly volume.According to the data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on Monday, domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales were at 2,65,389 units in the same month last year.

We defended quite well, we were clinical. It’s not easy to keep the level but we did it.”Despite the scoreline, City had 12 shots to Basel’s 11 and the Swiss could have taken an early lead.Dimitri Oberlin got clear of City’s defence and tried to poke the ball past Ederson as the Brazilian rushed out of his area but got no power on the ball allowing Kyle Walker to clear easily.Oberlin also had a penalty appeal turned down as he went over under a challenge from Nicolas Otamendi.Reality struck for Basel in the 14th minute when Gundogan beat Fabian Frei to Kevin de Bruyne’s corner and headed in.Four minutes later, Leo Lacroix failed to cut out Raheem Sterling’s cross and the unmarked Silva lobbed his shot over Tomas Vaclik’s attempted save, then Aguero scored the third from outside the area — City’s fourth shot on target of the game.Ederson made his first real save in the 49th minute, palming away Mohamed Elyounoussi’s long-range shot, but shortly afterwards, Aguero set up Gundogan who took one touch and placed a looping shot into the far corner.A brilliant Vaclik save denied Gundogan a hat-trick late on but, even so, the second leg looks little more than a formality for Guardiola’s side.', 'Samsung has been in the rumour mill since a while and now some newly leaked patents have shed light on what “Galaxy X” might look like and how it might work, as per Sammobile.

On the top, the image shows the video feed of the video call that is ensuing, while the bottom showcases several images, offering different functions to the bottom display when the phone is held vertically.The second patent showcases a different multi-window UI for the rear camera of the device, as per the cited source. The camera interface is split into two half similar to the UI for video calls, but here the orientation of the foldable smartphone is horizontal. The image explains that on the left side of the screen users can change picture quality settings, meanwhile, the right side shows the picture that is being captured by the rear camera sensor.The other patents suggest that the foldable smartphone could also have different aspect ratios than those taken using traditional handsets. To address that, the South Korean giant might develope multi-window software features that will make sure that the content is fitted across both screens without getting distorted, according to the patent.The patents below show a couple of UX/UI ideas by Samsung, a foldable phone that has an all-screen design, as per cited source cited source.As of now, it is not known whether any of the designs in the patents will come to the handset. Samsung files hundreds of patent applications every year with many of them never turned into a reality. The Galaxy X is expected to show up either sometime this year or next year.', 'New Delhi: Those who wolf down their food instead of chewing it properly are at a risk of gaining weight, a study has said.Instead, taking the time to chew your food and pausing before taking the next bite could help you shed those extra kilos.Losing weight is not an easy feat to accomplish, even when you have set a specific target. It requires hard work, discipline, dedication, immense will-power, and self-control.It is a slow and steady process and many people go to all sorts of lengths to achieve their desired goals like trying out all sorts of diets that suit their requirements or have been proven effective, in order to quicken the process.A lot of people even tend to give up halfway through their journey, simply because they run out of patience.For this research involving nearly 60,000 Japanese people, results showed a link between eating slower or faster and losing or gaining weight.“Changes in eating speed can affect changes in obesity, BMI and waist circumference,” a research duo from Japan’s Kyushu University wrote in the journal BMJ Open. “Interventions aimed at reducing eating speed may be effective in preventing obesity and lowering the associated health risks.”BMI stands for Body Mass Index, a ratio of weight-to-height used to determine whether a person falls within a healthy range. The WHO considers someone with a BMI of 25 overweight, and 30 or higher obese.In line with recommendations by the Japanese Society for the Study of Obesity, however, a BMI of 25 was taken as obese for Japanese populations for the purposes of the study. The researchers aanalyzedhealth insurance data from 59,717 individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes – a form of the disease that generally hits in adulthood as a result of being overweight.The participants had regular check-ups from 2008 to 2013. Data captured included their age and gender, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, eating habits, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use.From the outset, the slow-eating group of 4,192 had a smaller average waist circumference, a mean BMI of 22.3, and fewer obese individuals – 21.5 percent of the total.It’s not a race\\nBy comparison, more than 44 percent of the fast-eating group of 22,070 people, was obese, with a mean BMI of 25. The team also noted changes in eating speed over the six years, with more than half the trial group reporting an adjustment in one direction or the other.“The main results indicated that decreases in eating speeds can lead to reductions in obesity and BMI,” they found. Other factors that could help people lose weight, according to the data, included to stop snacking after dinner, and not to eat within two hours of going to bed.Skipping breakfast did not seem to have any effect. Limitations of the study included that eating speed and other behaviors were self-reported. There was also no data on how much participants ate, or whether they exercised or not.Commenting on the research, Simon Cork of Imperial College London said it “confirms what we already believe, that eating slowly is associated with less weight gain than eating quickly.” This may be due to the fact that the satiety signal takes some time to travel from the stomach to the brain, and may arrive only after the fast eater has already consumed more than enough.But he said that relying on the participants themselves to score whether they eat slowly, or fast, was “considerably subjective” and may skew the data. Katarina Kos, an obesity researcher from Exeter Medical School, said similar research has to be conducted in non-diabetic people to rule out a potential role for diabetes medication in weight loss or gain.', 'In a bizarre move, a hospital decided to detain a baby since birth, after the mother failed to pay the medical bills. The incident took place in a private clinic in Central African nation Gabon. Baby Angel was born to Sonia Okome over five months. A premature baby, Angel was kept in an incubator for 35 days. After the mother was unable to pay the high bill charges of 2 million CFA (Rs 2,41,100), the hospital decided to keep the baby, separating the little one from the mother.The incident, which shocked many, was covered extensively by the country’s media.Later, a public campaign to raise money to free the baby as launched on the family’s behalf. Several public figures, including President Ali Bongo, contributed to the bill amount.After five long months, Baby Angel finally united with her mother. Later, the private clinic’s director was arrested on baby-kidnapping charges, but the charges were dropped a day later, reported BBC.

While not specifying exactly where the drugs were found, the statement was accompanied by photos of a pair of multicoloured swim trunks that had two brown bags attached to the rear.Daily newspaper Publico and other media said the man was arrested after he arrived from Belem in northern Brazil wearing “fake buttocks” stuffed with cocaine under his swim trunks. He had also swallowed bags of cocaine, it added.Police said they arrested a second man at Lisbon’s main rail station who they suspect was the intended recipient of the cocaine. The two men, aged 32 and 40, face drug trafficking charges.', 'Washington: President Donald Trump Wednesday criticised India for a high import duty on the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles and threatened to increase the import tariff on “thousands and thousands” of Indian motorcycles to the US.During a discussion with members of the Congress on the steel industry, Mr Trump said the recent decision of the Indian government to reduce the tariff from 75 per cent to 50 per cent was not enough and asked that it should be reciprocal, as the US imposes “zero tax” on the import of motorcycles. “We have so many countries where we made a product, they make a product, they pay a tremendous we pay a tremendous tax to get into their countries motorcycles, Harley Davidson it goes into a certain country. I won’t mention the fact that it happens to be India, in this case,” the US president said amidst laughter from the audience.Mr Trump also indirectly referred to the recent conversation he had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.“And a great gentleman called me from India and he said, we have just reduced the tariff on motorcycles, reduced it down to 50 per cent from 75, and even 100 per cent,” Mr Trump said, in an apparent reference to his last week’s conversation with Prime Minister Modi.“..If you are Harley Davidson, you have 50 to 75 per cent tax, tariff to get your motorcycle, your product in. And yet they sell thousands and thousands of motorcycles, which a lot of people don t know, from India into the United States. You know what our tax is? Nothing,” he told the lawmakers and his Cabinet colleagues.Mr Trump once again pitched for a “reciprocal tax” on countries that he says “abuse” their trade relationships with the US.“So I say we should have reciprocal taxes for a case like that. I’m not blaming India. I think it s great that they can get away with it. I don t know why people allowed them to get away with it. But there’s an example that’s very unfair. And I think we should have a reciprocal tax,” the US president said.Mr Trump has floated the idea of a reciprocal tax in the past, promising to slap it on countries, including allies, that take advantage of the United States and its huge market.“That’s called fair trade. It’s called free trade. Because ultimately, what’s going to happen — either we’ll collect the same that they’re collecting, or, probably, what happens is they’ll end up not charging a tax and we won’t have a tax. And that becomes free trade,” Mr Trump said.Imported motorcycles from high-end brands, including Harley Davidson and Triumph, are set to get cheaper as the government slashed customs duty to 50 per cent.Earlier, import of motorcycles with engine capacity of 800cc or less used to attract 60 per cent duty, while those with capacity of 800cc or more attracted 75 per cent duty.The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), through a notification on February 12, has slashed the duty on both these variants of motorcycles imported as completely built units (CBU) to 50 per cent.Indian industry experts said the import duty rates have been rationalised for these motorcycles as it has been an industry demand for long and such high-end bikes are not manufactured in India currently.', 'New Delhi: Condemning the calls made by the opposition leaders seeking Indian military intervention to resolve the country’s political crisis, Maldives government on Tuesday said that such actions are ‘a threat to nation’s independence and national security’.A statement issued by the Maldivian Defence Ministry said, “The government views such actions to be irresponsible and intended to cause the citizens of both nations, as well as other stakeholders, to cast doubt upon the excellent relationship India and Maldives have enjoyed for decades.”The Maldivian government called “on all parties to refrain from such calls” and reiterated that it had maintained good relations with India since the country declared its independence.The statement added that the Maldives “firmly believes that India would not act on any such calls.”However, further in a tone of serving a warning, the statement said, “We would like to assure all our beloved citizens that Maldives does not have to fear for its independence or sovereignty and that the Government would not give any opportunity to anyone to threaten the country’s sovereignty.”Maldives, which has seen a number of political crisis since the ouster of its first democratically-elected president Nasheed in 2012, plunged into a political chaos after the Supreme Court ordered the release of nine imprisoned opposition politicians, maintaining that their trials were “politically motivated and flawed”.The nine political leaders included Nasheed.Also read: Amid political crisis, Maldives sends envoys to ‘friendly’ nations, India excludedThe Abdulla Yameen government refused to comply with the ruling, which prompted a wave of protests in Maldivian capital, Male.Following clashes and protests, the Yameen government imposed the emergency.', 'Rohtak: National-level kabaddi player Preeti has filed a complaint against her parents alleging that her family is putting pressure on her to get married despite her willingness to continue her studies along with sports.Preeti, originally a resident of Mahavati village of Panipat is currently residing in Rohtak to pursue her Bachelor of Arts (BA) from Vaish College in Rohtak, while her family has been living in Karnal for four years. She has alleged that her father came to Rohtak in September, 2017, and forcibly took her to Karnal, where they settled her relationship with a man, much older than her.When Preeti refused to marry, her parents even locked her up in a room for several days.She has met Haryana Women Commission with her complaint and has also written to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Haryana director general of police (DGP) and Karnal Superintendent of police (SP) to ask for their help in the matter.Preeti said, “I want to shape my future but my family is forcing me to get married. They also abuse me physically to not let me play in the tournaments. They also do not allow me to go to college. I somehow managed to appear for my exams.”“After reading the news, my family is looking for me and is threatening me emotionally. I do not want to face them. If anything unfortunate happens to me during this time then the sole responsibility will be my father’s,” she added.Pratibha Suman, Chairperson of Haryana Women Commission, said, “Preeti met me and told that her family is pressuring her to get married.

Zeliang whose tenure was “riddled with massive corruption, instability, misgovernance, propaganda and lies”, said Rio, who has already being elected to the assembly without contest.“Leadership should be visionary, strong and should keep its commitment to the people. His (Zeliang) leadership is without vision, and he leads from behind instead of from the front,” he said while addressing a series of election rallies in Peren district ahead of the February 27 assembly elections.On the “unabated propaganda” against the NDPP-BJP alliance, the former Chief Minister said: “We are not going to join the BJP. But we have to maintain a good rapport with the Central government so that we can expedite the peace process and carry forward the development agenda of the Central government for the benefit of our people and by empowering our youth and people living in rural areas”.He said that the BJP’s central leaders were aware that the Nagas have an ongoing political issue, and after he conveyed to them the importance of respecting the faith of the Nagas, the BJP settled for only 20 seats and agreed to let the NDPP contest the remaining 40 seats.“We have not aligned with the BJP to convert but to protect our rights as enshrined in Article 371A and therefore, our relationship with the Central government is very important. “Article 25-28 under the Constitution of India guarantees secularism and the freedom of religion to all its citizens and therefore, no one needs to fear since it is our constitutional right to profess the faith of our choice. We are Christians and there is no compromise on that,” he said.', 'Agartala: Congress president Rahul Gandhi will seek votes for his party on the last day of campaigning in the poll-bound northeastern state Tripura on Friday.According to reports, the Congress chief will address a public meeting at Ramkrishna Mahavidyalaya Stadium Ground in Unakoti district.Assembly polls will be held in Tripura on February 18 and the results will be declared on March 3.The CPI(M)-led Left Front government is ruling Tripura for 35 years since 1978 sans a gap of five years from 1988 to 1993. A coalition partner of Congress and now-defunct Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti had ruled the state during that five years.This time, the Narendra Modi-powered BJP is contesting 51 out of the 60 Assembly seats, while its ally Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) is fighting on nine seats.The Congress had fielded candidates for all the 60 seats in the state, but one of them withdrew his nomination later.The Trinamool Congress (TMC), which had faced a jolt last year in the state after six of its MLAs joined the BJP, has formed an alliance with the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra (INPT) and the National Conference of Tripura for the upcoming election.The Mamata Banerjee-led party has fielded candidates from 24 constituencies in the north-eastern state.', 'NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University is in the limelight yet again for the wrong reasons. The students at the JNU are up in arms against Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar’s decision to make 75 percent attendance compulsory at the varsity. Students on Thursday gheraoed the campus and stopped Rectors Chintamani Mahapatra and Rana Pratap Singh and other staff members from leaving the building.A human chain was formed by students around the building, skits and mimes were performed through the day near the main entrance of the administration block to mark their protest against the administrative decision. Security guards had to be deployed to block the students from entering the building.  The students have been demanding the revocation of the decision to have compulsory 75 percent attendance in an academic year to availing scholarships and fellowships.While staff members claim that students had confined a few professors and abused them, the students, led by JNU Students Union, refuted the charges. “We demand to meet the JNU VC. We have been waiting to meet him since the morning. We have not blocked any gate, we are only waiting for him. We demand the circular over mandatory attendance be taken back and call a meeting of the academic council,” Geeta, All India Students Association said.The JNUSU said there had been no call to lay siege to the administration building. “All administrative works have been going on without any obstruction,” JNUSU joint secretary Shubhanshu Singh said, adding the gherao would continue till the vice chancellor met the students.Calling the gherao an “illegal confinement”, a group of professors sat on a dharna after they were not allowed to go in to let their colleagues out. The students raised slogans against the professors.Defending the decision of compulsory attendance Chief Proctor Kaushal Kumar said that they are merely following UGC guidelines, not JNU guidelines. “Students have all the right to protest as they feel it is injustice according to them. Ask anyone about compulsory attendance, they will say it is needed,” the Chief Proctor, who was gheraoed for nearly two hours,  said.He also said that the decision was passed by a majority in the Academic Council. “Though it was not mentioned in the agenda, one of the centres brought up the issue in the Academic Council and the VC said it must be implemented. The JNU works according to statutes and ordinances,” he said.', 'Bengaluru: In a big relief to Karnataka, the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Friday said that it will get an additional 14.75 tmcft water from the Cauvery river. In an attempt to amicably resolve the decades-old dispute over sharing of the river water, the SC ordered Karnataka to provide 177.2 tmcft water to Tamil Nadu instead of the 192 tmcft water it gave away earlier. The apex court verdict implies that Karnataka will now get an additional 14.75 tmcft as compared to the previous 2007 order. ”Karnataka will now release 177.25 tmcft of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu from its inter-state Biligundlu dam,” the apex court said in its order.Tamil Nadu will now get 404.25 tmcft of Cauvery water instead of 419 tmcft allotted by 2007 tribunal and the award of 30 tmcft to Kerala and 7 tmcft to Puducherry will remain unchanged, the top court said.”No deviance shall be shown by any state,” the Supreme Court said while delivering the Cauvery verdict.The top court also made it clear that increase in the share of Cauvery water for Karnataka by 14.75 tmcft has been done keeping in view the fact that there is an increased demand of drinking water by Bengaluru and also for many industrial activities.The top court further ruled that the 20 TMC of groundwater in Tamil Nadu had not been accounted for and needed to be seen. However, it allowed Tamil Nadu to draw additional 10 tmcft ‘groundwater’ from total of 20 tmcft beneath Cauvery basin.  The verdict was delivered by the three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Amitava Roy and AM Khanwilkar.The apex court ruling has been widely welcomed by politicians and activists from Karnataka, however, the leading political parties in Tamil Nadu, including DMK and the AIADMK, have termed it as a ”shocker” and ”extremely disappointing”.   In his first reaction to the development, Mohan V Katarki, counsel for the state of Karnataka, said, ”We are very happy with the verdict. It is a balance verdict which protects the interest of both the states. This is a good judgement which will go long way in ensuring peace in both the states.”We are very happy with the verdict.

Bengaluru Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar had earlier informed that at least 15,000 police personnel were deployed on duty. Karnataka State Reserve Police Force and personnel from other forces were also deployed to avoid any untoward incident across the state.Meanwhile, bus services between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were affected. Commuters in Hosur claimed that the number of buses plying to Karnataka has been reduced in the wake of the verdict in Cauvery water sharing dispute case.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala had challenged the 2007 order of the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal (CWDT) on sharing of Cauvery water.  The three states had sought modification of Cauvery Tribunal’s final order. The bench had reserved its order on the matter on September 20, 2017.The state governments in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Puducherry had filed petitions seeking modification of Cauvery Tribunal’s final order. The verdict holds significance since sharing the Cauvery water is an emotive as well existential issue for thousands of families dependent on the river that flows between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The 120-year-old Cauvery water dispute was earlier decided unanimously by CWDT in 2007, after determining the total availability of water in the Cauvery basin at 740 thousand million cubic (tmc) feet at the Lower Coleroon Anicut site, including 14 tmcft for environmental protection.', 'Srinagar: A fierce gunbattle between security forces and some unidentified terrorists is currently underway in Jammu and Kashmir’s Baramulla district on Friday.According to ANI, the security forces are currently engaged in a fierce gunbattle with a group of terrorists in Palhalan area of Baramulla’s Pattan.#SpotVisuals: Encounter underway between security forces and terrorists in Palhalan area of Baramulla’s Pattan.

Earlier on Thursday, some unidentified terrorists had targeted a CRPF camp in Awantipora area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Security personnel, however, returned fire, forcing the terrorists to flee.The incident comes days after two LeT terrorists were killed in 32-hour gunbattle in Jammu and Kashmir’s Karan Nagar area.Just recently, a group of terrorists linked to JeM had stormed the Sunjwan army camp in Jammu, killing at least five security personnel and one civilian. Six army personnel and six civilians were injured in the attack.', 'Washington: The US Senate on Thursday rejected a slew of immigration reform proposals, including one backed by President Donald Trump, leaving hundreds of thousands of young migrants who were brought to the country illegally as children in limbo.The Senate also shot down a bipartisan deal on immigration offered by the Trump administration which had offered to provide citizenship 1.8 million American’s so-called “Dreamers” in exchange of USD 25 billion for construction of a wall along the Mexican border and other security measures.Senators, in a series of votes, failed to muster enough votes for either of the immigration plan to move ahead. In fact, the bill backed by Trump lost 39-60 votes. If passed, the bill would have paved the way for permanent legal status to 1.8 million young legal immigrants and provided USD 25 billion towards building a wall along the Mexico border.The White House supported bill would have also curbed family-based immigration and ended diversity lottery visa. But the bill fell far short of 60 votes mark required to clear a filibuster.The Senate also rejected another bipartisan bill 54-45, which was again short of the 60 votes required to clear filibuster. Trump described the Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill a “total catastrophe”. The White House threatened to veto the bill.All four proposals put forward today failed.“Every amendment before the Senate today failed to pass because, as I have said since our effort in 2013, the more an immigration proposal tries to do at once, the less likely it is to succeed,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio said.Rubio said he intends to keep working with other Senators on a more limited proposal that would permanently codify DACA’s renewable permits and provide meaningful border security and enforcement measures in the event a House-passed bill cannot pass the Senate.The fate of the Dreamers has been uncertain since Trump scrapped the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program last September and gave Congress six months to legislate a solution.Some 690,000 Dreamers who registered under DACA — plus 1.1 million others who were eligible but did not sign up — could begin to face deportation beginning March 5 if no deal is reached.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said: “The President must stop sabotaging the bipartisan compromises he’s asked for, and the Republican Congress must have the courage to pass legislation to protect Dreamers now.”The defeat of the immigration bills, also put a pause on the efforts to remove per country cap on green card, a move that could have benefited a large number of high skilled Indian professionals.Speaking on the floor of the House, Congressman Kevin Yoder said the per-country caps on green cards for highly skilled H-1B immigrants unfairly discriminate against immigrants from a few countries, especially India.“The caps have created a huge backlog of Indian applicants who will have to wait decades–as much as 70 years– to achieve their dream of American citizenship,” he said, demanding that the per-country caps must be replaced by a merit-based system that treats everyone fairly, regardless of their country of origin.New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez cited the case of an Indian-American to push for the immigration reform. “When we talk about Dreamers, we are talking about kids who have grown up American in every sense of the word. We are talking about 22,000 New Jerseyans like Parthiv Patel, who came to New Jersey from India when he was 5 years old,” Menendez said on the Senate floor.“He gained DACA status in 2012. He graduated from Drexel Law School in 2016, and he became the first Dreamer admitted to the New Jersey Bar in 2018,” he said.In his remarks, Menendez, a Democratic Senator, claimed that Trump does not have a plan for merit-based immigration.“When President Trump professes his support for merit- based immigration, he doesn’t have a real plan for allowing a million engineers and inventors from around the world to come to the United States. He is talking about cutting legal immigration by nearly 50 per cent,” he said.“That is a policy with disastrous implications for the future of this country when you consider basic economic facts. Any credible economist will tell you that without steady immigration, America’s global competitiveness will suffer, and we will fall far behind much larger countries like China, Pakistan, and India. According to a Forbes magazine article, even President Donald Trump is a product of chain migration,” Menendez said.Menendez said this is not the time to talk about a merit-based immigration reform.Senator John Cornyn, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus, said there is an opportunity to address not only the anxiety and plight of DACA recipients but also to make the country safer and more secure.', 'New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be holding ‘pariksha pe charcha’ -a unique programme aimed at helping lakhs of students appearing for exams relieve the stress.According to reports, PM Modi will connect with lakhs of students and thousands of schools across the country and discuss exam-related issues through a video conference from Delhi’s Talkatora Stadium at 12:00 noon.PM Modi took to Twitter and expressed his ‘eagerness’ to hold ‘pariksha pe charcha’ with students today.”I am extremely eager to interact with young friends, teachers and parents on the need to appear for exams with a smile, without any stress,” the PM had tweeted.I am extremely eager to interact with young friends, teachers and parents on the need to appear for exams with a smile, without any stress.

It is a collection of anecdotes from the PM’s school days and snatches from his monthly radio address “Mann Ki Baat” on coping with study stress.“Trying to become someone is a conventional path…. Take the road less travelled,” he says in the book. “Be a warrior, not a worrier,” reads another idea.The PM has often spoken about exam stress and tackled the subject in his radio talk.A year ago, PM Modi had advised students to “treat exams like festivals” and not to take too much stress. “A happy mind is the secret of a good mark sheet,” he had said.', 'The latest Indian viral sensation, Priya Prakash Varrier, a debutante in Malayalam film industry, has become a rage on social media.

BSF commandant Jibu T Mathew, who was held with around Rs. 45 lakh on January 31, was denied bail by the CBI court here on Thursday.According to sources, the CBI had strongly objected to granting bail to Jibu saying that there were chances of him destroying evidence. The CBI also informed the court that international smuggler Bushu Sheik would be arraigned as the second accused in the case. He was still absconding. Meanwhile, CBI sources said that it was hard to believe that Jibu alone helped the smuggling rackets. He was only one commandant. There were many BSF personnel under him guarding the Indo – Bangla borders. Hence there was every chance of connivance of more BSF personnel in the smuggling, said sources.The CBI already received strong evidence of  Jibu’s links with the smuggling racket involving Bushu Sheik. One of the mobile phones recovered from Jibu was of a number taken using fake address proofs. The phone only contained a few contact numbers. Those were suspected to be of Bushu Sheik and other racketeers.Sources also said that though Jibu told CBI officials that he had only facilitated smuggling of cattle, the CBI was yet to take it into account as smuggling of fake currency, drugs and manpower is quite rampant along the Indo – Bangla border. Jibu, who hails from Pathanamthitta, was serving as BSF 83rd battalion commandant at the South Bengal frontier near Murshidabad. He was held from the Shalimar Express with Rs 45 lakh.', 'Washington: US President Donald Trump has a “strong relationship” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a State Department official said Friday, emphasising that India-US ties are important.“President Trump, certainly has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Modi,” State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters at a news conference. “I know that his daughter (Ivanka) really enjoyed having been over in Hyderabad late last year, and so it’s an important relationship, an increasingly important relationship,” she said.Nauert also applauded India’s developmental role in Afghanistan.“This is a good example of the world coming together and working through – places that may not have – countries that may not have worked together in the past. This is an example of how that is now being done. Saudi Arabia is helping out in Iraq,” she said.Early February, US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said that “sky is the limit” for India-US ties and she praised Prime Minister Modi for being aggressive in pursuing economic and administrative reforms.', 'Another incident highlighting the ever rising hate crimes in US has come to light.Gujreet Singh a religious leader at a local Sikh gurudwara, who is also an Uber driver filed charges against a passenger who he claims held a gun to his head as a conversation about his ethnicity and religion spiralled out of control. The advocacy organisation Sikh Coalition claims that the passenger pointed a gun to the driver’s head and said, “I hate turban people. I hate beard people,” The Washington Post reported.The incident reportedly took place on 29th January and leader of Sikh Coalition are fretting over the fact that the sheriff’s office in Illinois is yet to arrest the passenger.Rock Island County Sheriff Gerry Bustos told the Washington Post that he was looking to book the passenger on charges of aggravated assault and is awaiting information that the sheriff’s office has requested from Uber.The driver, a co-passenger and the suspect have been interviewed so far, according to which the driver picked up both the passengers in Moline around 11 pm and were headed toward Milan, Illinois.The suspect then engaged Gujreet Singh in questions regarding his status in US and about where he came from and his loyalties, until it boiled up to an argument.“The argument was about where people’s loyalties lie. There was an argument over where people were from,” Bustos said.The Sikh Coalition claims that the suspect asked the driver questions like, “What is your status here? Which country do you belong to? Do you serve your country or do you serve our country?”Singh, who is a US resident retorted by saying that he served both countries which is when the suspect put a gun to his head and said he hated “turban people.” Following this the female co-passenger forced him out of the car as Singh brought the Uber to a halt and she apologised to Singh on the man’s behalf saying, “I’m sorry, he shouldn’t have said that to you.”The Sikh community is naturally perturbed that the man has not been arrested and frustrated with the continued discrimination and malice that they have to bear with.Sikhs have often fallen prey to hate crimes as many Americans confuse them for Muslims because of their appearance.A man had been murdered soon after 9/11 until it was learnt that the assailant had mistaken him for an Arab.Speaking about the incident Amrith Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition said, “If you say you hate turban people and you say you hate beard people and you put a gun to their head, that is a textbook hate crime.”She went on to add, “The problem of hatred in our communities is outrageous. Since 9/11, the Sikh community has experienced such violence in America. The fact that in 2018, it’s scary to be brown in America is completely unacceptable. People need to understand, this isn’t just an attack on an individual.”“We’re hoping to bring this case to resolution, certainly, for the Sikh community as quickly as possible, because I know they’re concerned,” Bustos said.“The moment we are able to file a criminal charge, we absolutely will,” he added.', 'Johannesburg: Cyril Ramaphosa was Thursday elected unopposed as South Africa’s new president, hours after long-time president Jacob Zuma resigned.Ramaphosa was elected unopposed in the National Assembly Thursday afternoon.

Turnbull denounced the affair at a press conference in Canberra after a week in which the scandal threw his centre-right government into turmoil and strained the alliance between his Liberal Party and Joyce’s National Party.He stopped short of sacking Joyce, which would have put the government’s narrow one-seat majority at risk were he expelled from parliament.But Turnbull said the scandal had prompted overdue changes to ministerial conduct rules, and announced new standards broadly similar to a ban on relationships between lawmakers and staffers adopted last week by US Congress.“In 2018, it is not acceptable for a minister to have a sexual relationship with somebody who works for them. It is a very bad workplace practice. And everybody knows that no good comes of it,” he said.“Ministers, regardless of whether they are married or single, must not engage in sexual relations with staff. Doing so will constitute a breach of the standards.He said the changes take effect “as of today” and that Joyce will “have to consider his own position” as leader of the National Party.Turnbull said earlier Joyce would take a week’s break next week, which avoids the need for him to fill in as acting prime minister during Turnbull’s scheduled visit to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington next week.The week off comes after an opinion poll showed support for Joyce, a plain-spoken small-town accountant turned politician, had tumbled in his rural electorate.The percentage of voters backing him crashed to 43 percent, according to the ReachTEL poll published in Fairfax newspapers on Thursday, down from the 63 percent margin he won at a by-election in December.He also faces intensifying pressure over his failure to declare the relationship with his former press secretary, Vikki Campion, when she was hired for two highly-paid government positions outside his office.And there are questions about Joyce’s acceptance, rent-free, of a townhouse belonging to a wealthy friend, Greg Maguire, and whether Joyce broke ministerial rules forbidding asking for gifts. Joyce denied asking for the townhouse.“Most people would realise that at the time of a marriage break-up, it is not unusual for those who you are close to, to offer support,” he told parliament.“Mr Maguire approached me…he said: ‘You’re living out of a suitcase, and this is basically something that I should try and help you with.’ I took him up on the offer but I offered to pay for it.”He has also said he did not break any rules over Campion’s employment because she was not his “partner” at the time.', 'Mumbai: The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced by over 196 points in early trade on Friday on buying by institutional and retail investors in IT, banking and FMCG stocks.Asian markets were trading in the green following positive lead from Wall Street as investors continued to shun inflation worries.

Locals made a call to the police after Rajashekar’s mother-in-law Verakonda Bala Laxmi noticed the head of a baby girl on the terrace while she went to dry clothes.The baby’s head was lying on the south-west corner of the terrace. The baby was kidnapped from the roadside in Boyaguda on January 31 night by Rajashekar as he was searching for a female baby to sacrifice. “His wife was unwell for the past four years and the couple visited one Sammaka Saralamma two years ago in Medaram where they met one Koya Dora who asked them to go for ‘narabali’, (human sacrifice) of a girl child to get rid of evil spirits causing her illness. He then consulted three black magicians regarding the issue,” police commissioner of Rachakonda, Mahesh Bhagwat said.Rajashekar, who was arrested by Uppal police on Thursday morning, had earlier said that on January 31, they had closed doors around 12.30 am and around 2 pm upon hearing the dogs barking, his sleep was disturbed. But he said that he went back to sleep again after having some water. However, police officials found substantial evidence which inclined the case towards him.“A blood stain was found on the floor of their house on February 9, which was collected by the Clues team and was sent for analysis. The results came on Tuesday, confirming that the blood stains found inside the house were matching with that on the terrace,” the official said. Rajashekar was then grilled about the case once again with the latest discovery of blood samples and he confessed of murdering the baby. For performing the ‘Kshudra Puja’, the couple had sent their two kids to a relative’s place a day before. On January 31, Rajasekhar took out his car and kidnapped  the baby who was sleeping on the roadside with her parents. “He went there with a knife and a plastic bag, picked up the sleeping baby, along with a feeding bottle, and proceeded towards Musi river in the outskirts of Prathap Singaram. Around 2 am, he mercilessly beheaded the child and flung the body into the river along with the knife and waited for about half-an-hour for the bleeding to stop. He then kept the head in a polythene bag and reached home around 3 am.” the police commissioner of Rachakonda, Mahesh Bhagwat said. A feeding bottle was also found in Rajashekar’s car, he added. He did the heinous act under the persuasion of his wife Srilatha.Accordingly, police then picked up his wife from their residence and booked cases against them under Section 302 (murder), 366 (Kidnapping), 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 120 B (Criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.', 'Mumbai: Priyanka Chopra, who featured in one of the advertisement campaigns for billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, is currently seeking legal opinion to terminate her contract with the brand, the actor’s spokesperson said on Thursday.On Wednesday, state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) said it has detected a Rs11,400 crore fraud where Nirav Modi allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking from a branch in Mumbai to secure overseas credit from other Indian lenders. On reports of her taking legal action against the brand for alleged non-payment of dues for the ad campaign, Chopra’s spokesperson said in a statement, “There are speculative reports that Priyanka Chopra has sued Nirav Modi. This is not true. However, she is currently seeking legal opinion with respect to terminating her contract with the brand in light of allegations of financial fraud against Nirav Modi.”Actor Sidharth Malhotra, who also featured in the same advertisement with Priyanka, told PTI that since his contract is already over with the brand he is not planning any legal action.Last week, PNB had lodged a complaint with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stating that fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) worth Rs280.7 crore were first issued on 16 January. At the time, PNB had said it was digging into records to examine the magnitude of the fraud.On Thursday, Enforcement Directorate conducted multiple searches in connection with a Rs280 crore money-laundering case against the designer and others following a complaint by PNB.Nirav Modi (47), who had figured in the Forbes’ list of richest Indians, was booked by CBI for cheating after PNB sent a complaint to it alleging that the jewellery firm owner, his wife, his brother and business partner Mehul Choksi entered into a criminal conspiracy with the officials of the bank and cheated it, causing a “wrongful loss”.

Number one is a tough place to get to. The most important thing is to be healthy, I would have had great regrets if I had not come here this week. I’m very excited for tomorrows match, I can’t wait for it to come around.”Federer moved into the quarter-finals on Thursday with a hard-fought 7-6 (10/8), 7-5 victory over Germanys Philipp Kohlschreiber. “Tonight was complicated, I had to fight and struggle,” said Federer who has won three of the last five majors. “I had a good game plan going in, but I was never able to completely pull it off.“He came out with a clean start. I was serving well, that’s a great sign. I’d rather do that and return poorly.” Thursdays win was Federer’s 13th in as many meetings against Kohlschreiber.Second seed Grigor Dimitrov outlasted Serbia’s Filip Krajinovic 7-6 (7/4), 7-5 to also reach the quarter-finals. Dimitrov has now reached a second straight quarter-final in the Dutch city, advancing with 13 aces and saving all four break points he faced.

Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”Aniston and Theroux were engaged in August of 2012 and married in August of 2015. They have no children.The two worked together on 2012′s “Wanderlust,” in which she starred.They said they are “two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”Theroux, 46, had a small role in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and has several films slated for release this year, including Netflix’s “Mute” out this month. His writing credits include “Tropic Thunder,” ″Iron Man 2″ and “Zoolander 2.”Theroux said in an interview earlier this week that he and Aniston were not together on her Feb. 11 birthday, and he would not be spending Valentine’s Day with her.Aniston, 49, is featured on the cover of the current issue of Architectural Digest with a story about the “pure domestic bliss” of the Beverly Hills, California, home she shared with Theroux.

Apart from providing instant access to credit, they help reduce your cost of transaction through attractive reward points, cashback and discounts.However, these very same features lure many to spend beyond their means. With credit card interest rate ranging between 18–48 per cent p.a., the outstanding balance keep piling up, forcing many to seek debt settlement with the card issuers. We don’t realize that debt settlement inflicts more harm than good by ruining our credit score and subsequently restrict loan eligibility for a considerable period time. If you too are entangled in a credit card debt trap, these four debt management options should help you pull out of it.Credit card balance transfer:You could consider transferring your existing credit card debt to another credit card at a lower interest rate. It can either be a fresh credit card or one of your existing credit cards.The transferee card issuer would extend promotional interest period during which a lower (or even 0 per cent interest rate) will be charged on the balance transferred for 3 to 6 months. This not only slows down the accrual of interest component, it would also provide a window period to save or arrange funds for repayment.Keep in mind that the transferred balance will attract the usual interest rate after the end of the promotional period. Many card issuers also allow the repayment of the transferred debt through EMIs.Fresh loan at lower interest rates:The interest rates offered on personal loans, gold loans, loan against fixed deposits, etc. is much lower than the rates charged by credit cards. While interest rates on credit cards usually range between 18–48 per cent, personal loans come at much lower interest rate, ranging anywhere between 11–24 per cent.In case, you fail to avail a personal loan due to low credit score or insufficient income, you can opt for secured loans like gold loan and loan against securities.Conversion of outstanding dues into EMIs:Some card issuers allow you to convert your entire outstanding card balance into equated monthly installments (EMIs) against the payment of a small processing fee.  The tenure of such EMIs is usually between 3 to 12 months and the rate of interest can be as low as 1.04 per cent per month. However, non-payment of EMIs by due date would attract standard interest rates on the balance amount.Liquidation/Redemption of investments:Opt for this option only if certain investments do not yield high rate of returns. For instance, closing your FDs for repaying your credit card debt would make sense as bank FDs may not pay you an interest rate of more than 6-9 per cent p.a. This is much lower than the interest rate charged on alternative debt consolidation options such as personal loan, gold loan, balance conversion, etc.However, you must avoid redeeming high-yielding investment options such as equity mutual funds for repaying credit card debt, especially if they are attached to your long term financial goals or the equity market is going through a correction phase.', 'M-tech has launched a new feature phone dubbed as Boss.

Only a few media personnel have been invited to the event while the rest of the world will witness the unveil over the internet via a webcast link. The Polo will make its first public debut at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show which starts on September 14.A few days back, Volkswagen released a teaser image of the new Polo and a video on YouTube, which summarised how the car has evolved since it was first launched in 1975. In its 42 years of existence, VW has sold over 14 million of these worldwide. This time around, the Polo will enter into its sixth generation and is likely to grow in size as well. That translates to better cabin space, something that the current car is infamous for. Despite that, the new Polo is expected to weigh around 70kg less than the current one, thanks to the smallest version of the Volkswagen’s MQB platform – MQB A0. This will surely help in returning better fuel economy figures.We all know how the new Polo will look like as various test mules have been spotted, some without any camouflage, since the beginning of this year. The design, as expected, is subtly conservative. As far as the engine family for the new Polo is concerned, it will be sold worldwide with options from a 1.0-litre TSI, 1.5-litre TSI and 1.6-litre TDI. Ruling the line-up will be a GTI variant which will, in most probability, house a turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol mill, producing around 200PS.For India, Volkswagen has confirmed that in the near future, the only all-new car that will make its way here is the sixth-gen (globally, third-gen for India) Passat.', 'New Delhi: Team India all-rounder Suresh Raina is all set to return to the national team after a long hiatus of over a year. The Uttar Pradesh cricketer was selected for the upcoming three-match T20I series against South Africa in January, after failing the BCCI-mandatory Yo-Yo fitness test.Raina’s comeback will see him reunite with India skipper Virat Kohli, with whom has developed a good rapport with over the years. The southpaw, who lifted the 2011 ICC World Cup along with the dashing right-hander feels that Kohli could grab the limelight during the 2019 ICC World Cup and that he could well be one of the contenders for the ‘man of the tournament’.“Virat Kohli is very hungry – hunger is there in his eyes. His fitness has been remarkable. Every time he rotates the strike – whenever he gets the loose balls, he looks to punish them. He is the best in the world, no doubt about it. He wants to win the World Cup very badly – probably in England, he will be the man of the tournament,” he was quoted saying by India Today.The 31-year-old further stated that people are yet to see the best version of himself and believes it is only a matter of time before runs start flowing from his willow again.“My peak is yet to come, my time will start from here on. Still timing the ball really well, have a few good bats. Need to be patient to bat at No.4,” he added.With the likes of Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, Kedar Jadhav and Ajinkya Rahane waiting in the wings, a few good knocks for Raina in the African continent can help him cement his spot in Kohli’s limited-overs squad.', 'New Delhi: Hockey’s governing body indicated that Pakistan will take part in the men’s World Cup this year in India despite acute tensions between the two countries.Pakistan have qualified for the World Cup to be held in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar between November 18 and December 16.

Ostersunds were gifted a chance to at least add a memorable goal to their fairytale run, but after Tesfaldet Tekie was brought down by Hector Bellerin, David Ospina saved Tom Pettersson’s injury-time penalty.The comfortable win means that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be able to rest his key players for the second leg at the Emirates in a week’s time. “We did the job well, controlled the ball against a good side,” Wenger told BT Sport.“Overall we played a serious game, so job done. They looked very nervous and we took advantage of it.”            Red-hot Batshuayi rescues Dortmund           Batshuayi continued his good form with a late brace as Dortmund fought back to beat Atalanta 3-2 at Signal Iduna Park.Dortmund forged ahead on the half-hour mark through Andre Schurrle, but Josip Ilicic’s quickfire double after half-time put Atalanta ahead.Dortmund hit back midway through the second period, though, as Batshuayi slammed in his fourth goal in three games for the club since joining on loan from Chelsea in January.And the Belgian striker pounced in the first minute of added time to give the two-time runners-up a precious lead in the tie.“The really disappointing thing is we threw away a game that we shouldn’t have lost,” admitted Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini.“After cradling the dream of winning, we suffered this disappointment in the final minutes. The second leg will not be easy.”Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid recovered from falling behind early on at FC Copenhagen to cruise to a 4-1 victory. Saul Niguez, Kevin Gameiro and Antoine Griezmann were all on the scoresheet as Diego Simoene’s La Liga title-chasers put one foot into the last 16.Serie A leaders Napoli have it all to do, though, after Germany international Timo Werner’s second-half brace led RB Leipzig to a shock 3-1 win in Italy. Patrick Cutrone and Fabio Borini scored as AC Milan claimed a 3-0 advantage over Ludogorets Razgrad to take back to the San Siro for the return leg.“I’m a bit angry, we could do a lot better. Having fast players they put us in trouble,” said a surprisingly disgruntled Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso.Mario Balotelli scored twice, but 10-man Nice blew a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at home to Lokomotiv Moscow as Manuel Fernandes hit a hat-trick, while Valere Germain struck two goals as Marseille cruised past Braga 3-0.A 78th-minute winner from Callum McGregor gave former European champions Celtic victory over Zenit St Petersburg at Parkhead, and Lazio were beaten 1-0 by FCSB in Bucharest.

You should not limit yourself as an actor. I sometimes feel like doing this or that or sometimes nothing. We have moods, feelings, and I am trying to live life. I am a cinema lover; I love watching different kinds of films. It is not a conscious decision; I have been like this forever. There is no growth, if you do not try out different things. You will not evolve,” Varun told PTI.The first teaser of the film was released recently and the 30-year-old actor says the fact that the film is not a “cliched love story” excited him about the offer. “We are not trying to break any stereotypes (of romantic Hindi films). Our film is not a cliched love story; it is done to an extent. Now we are trying to show something new. I know the story is close to his (Shoojit) heart.

I want to work with him again and again. There is always a message in his films. And this film too had one, which I never knew how to tell people… Subconsciously, I wanted to say this to the people. We want to say something that is right in front of you in life, and we never learn from it,” Varun says.‘October’ is set to release on April 13.', 'New Delhi: Come April when the country’s top cricketers crisscross the nation for IPL, Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara will be starting his “homework” for India’s ‘English Test’. Pujara will be turning out for English county heavyweights Yorkshire in Division 1 with an eye on five Test series against England in August.“I am looking forward to the county season as we will be playing Test matches in August. I was with Yorkshire in 2015 when we won the County Championship. It’s a fantastic team with good bunch of professionals, which helps me become a better cricketer,” Pujara told PTI during an exclusive interview at the Kotla today. According to Pujara, the most beneficial aspect will be playing county cricket at Test venues of India’s tour, which will give an idea about pitches and conditions. “Look, playing at Headingley in early English summer with temperatures around 4 or 6 degrees will test any batsmen’s technique and temperament. Even scoring a 50 is tough. By the time, India tour starts, it will be bit more pleasant,” said Pujara.“Now playing Division 1 has its advantages. I will be playing against Middlesex (Lord’s), Warwickshire (Birmingham) and Surrey (Oval) in away games, where India will play Test matches.So I will get a fair idea about the pitches and conditions,” Pujara explained further.For Pujara, there isn’t much change technique wise from South Africa to England. “The basics will remain the same but the primary criteria of doing well is respecting conditions.Technically, it’s more or less same. “I use lighter bats when playing overseas. Also the kind of fight we put in South Africa will augur well for us in England. May be we could have batted a bit better but we were in with a chance in all games,” said Pujara.The 30-year-old cricketer, who has played 57 matches in the longest format, agreed that none of the top Test teams are travelling well. “England’s performance in Ashes will tell you that all top teams are struggling a fair bit in overseas conditions.”As the discussion veered towards playing spinners, Pujara agreed that the team will be more well equipped to play Moeen Ali, who had tormented them with 19 wickets. “Obviously we will be better prepared but that doesn’t mean we can take Moeen or any other English bowler lightly.The best part is we have a fair idea about their core bowling unit,” said Pujara. Talking about South African batsmen not picking Yuzvendra Chahal or Kuldeep Yadav during ODI series, Pujara said: “It will be difficult if you can’t pick up the variation from wrists.“If you can’t differentiate Chahal’s googly from his flippers, then there’s trouble. You have to have an understanding which way the ball would turn.” He has not got an IPL deal during the past few seasons and he does admit that it has got a lot to do with “public perceptions”.“Perception I would say has played a major role. If you check my performance in List A (average of 58 plus over 88 games) and T20s (strike rate of 105.18 in 58 games), I still have a lot to offer in shorter formats. I am not at all worried as I know my opportunity would come at some point of time,” he signed off.', 'Centurion: A ruthless India has only complacency to guard against while a deflated South Africa would be fighting another battle of survival when the two sides clash in the series-deciding second Twenty20 International here on Wednesday.The Men in Blue won the first T20I at Johannesburg by 28 runs and a victory on Wednesday will see them wrap up another series win on this tour.A highly competitive 1-2 loss in the Tests, followed by a comprehensive 5-1 ODI triumph has made for quite a roller-coaster tour so far and the Indians would be aiming for a happy end to the long sojourn with a T20 victory.A prospective 3-0 series win would also help India climb up the ICC T20I Rankings and take up second spot behind Pakistan. However, if Australia beat New Zealand in the T20 tri-series’ final (on Wednesday as well), India would stay in their current third position.Word from the Indian camp is that Virat Kohli will be fit in time for game. The skipper had hobbled off in the latter stages of the previous game on Sunday with a left hip problem. The team management had deemed the issue “nothing serious”, and as such, he is expected to walk out at toss time tomorrow.Kohli had suffered a slight knee issue while fielding in the first ODI at Durban as well but he brushed it off to score a fine hundred thereafter. Even so, another injury scare only underlines his exhaustive workload.Wrapping up the series here might also enable Kohli to take time off and sit out the final T20I in Cape Town, keeping in mind his hectic schedule over the next three months.If at all, India do need to consider his absence from this second match, then KL Rahul would come in as a replacement.He was left out from the previous game in favour of Manish Pandey but now comes back into the reckoning owing to Kohli’s pending fitness ruling.However, it is not expected to be the only change to the playing eleven. While India have shown a propensity recently to play a left-arm pacer in their T20I eleven, Jaydev Unadkat’s inclusion in the Wanderers game was perhaps down more to the good batting conditions on offer.The pitch at SuperSport Park has played slow throughout this tour and the same is to be expected once more. In that light, India could once again opt for two spinners in the eleven.The one surprising element for India at the Wanderers was Suresh Raina’s elevation to number three. If Kohli does play, will he repeat this ploy once again?In Johannesburg, it was obvious that the team management had gauged conditions early and deemed 200 a par-score on that pitch.Thus, their move to send Raina up and attack during the powerplay overs with Kohli held back to anchor the middle-order, allowing the returning left-hander a license to free shot-making.To an extent, it does shore up India’s only frailty – lower middle order – particularly as the team management continues to back MS Dhoni in the shortest format.The former skipper is also reluctant to bat higher up in keeping with his penchant for finishing off the innings.Kohli’s ‘demotion’ to number four, despite staggering average at his favoured spot, helps stabilise the lower middle order at least in the short term.Meanwhile, only last Tuesday, South Africa had faced a do-or-die moment in Port Elizabeth and now have their backs up against the wall for a second time in eight days.The hosts had put their hopes in a basket full of new eggs. Yet, despite hitting the refresh button, they weren’t able to muster the required challenge for a high-flying Indian team at the moment.AB de Villiers is now ruled out of this T20I series (with a left knee problem) as well but Cricket South Africa has not named a replacement. So, JP Duminy must find solutions from within the available squad.The stand-in skipper was adamant that their plans at the Wanderers – including the decision to bowl short to India’s top-order in the powerplay overs – were sound enough, and just needed proper execution.It remains to be seen if the Centurion pitch will provide them enough bounce to try out the short-ball ploy once again, or indeed if the Proteas have thought of a plan B this time around.Teams (from):India: Virat Kohli (capt), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, KL Rahul, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, MS Dhoni (wk), Hardik Pandya, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Jaydev Unadkat, Shardul Thakur.South Africa: JP Duminy (capt), Farhaan Behardien, Junior Dala, Reeza Hendricks, Christiaan Jonker, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), David Miller, Chris Morris, Dane Paterson, Aaron Phangiso, Andile Phehlukwayo, Tabraiz Shamsi, Jon-Jon Smuts.', 'Chennai: Ravichandran Ashwin took to Twitter and shared his thoughts on superstar Kamal Haasan who gets ready to launch his political party on Wednesday.The Chennai cricketer wrote, “A day where another superstar actor from TN launches his political party this evening. The political landscape is set for a massive change? #KamalHaasan” Hours before the launch of his new political party, Kamal Haasan, on Wednesday, visited the house of ex-president APJ Abdul Kalam in Ramanathapuram, and spent time with his family members.The Indian off-spinner recently made the headlines after his Twitter fight with former South Africa cricketer Herschelle Gibbs. Both the players took jibe at each other, with Ashwin hitting back at the South African for his involvement in match-fixing.After playing the Test series in South Africa, Ashwin will now turn up for Kings XI Punjab in Indian Premier League in 2018.Ashwin played for Chennai Super Kings for eight years before the team was suspended for two years following spot-fixing saga. He, later on went onto to represent Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 season.', 'Lucknow: Terming contribution to Uttar Pradesh’s development his patriotic duty, Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani on Wednesday promised investment of another Rs 10,000 crore through Jio in the next three years.Speaking at the UP Investor Summit here, he said the investment will be over and above the Rs 20,000 crore Jio has already invested in the state in rolling out high-speed 4G telecom venture. Ambani said India cannot rise to its full potential without the rise of 22 crore people of Uttar Pradesh. He also vowed full support to the ‘Namami Gange’ project.“I have a commitment…. the Clean Ganga Mission is gathering momentum …we at Reliance Foundation would deem it as our pious duty to contribute to the success of this mission and are ready to execute whatever part of the project is assigned to us,” he said in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Promising to be a reliable partner of the people and government of UP, Ambani said he has come to the state to assure that Jio’s digital revolution will make maximum contribution to UP’s development, and announced four commitments in this regard including investment of another Rs 10,000 crore by Jio in the next three years.The RIL chief said he wanted every youth in the state to be a smart youth and for this Jio will make available over 2 crore phones in the state in the next two months on a priority basis.“Jio has already created over 40 thousand direct and indirect jobs in UP. Along with other businesses of RIL , Jio will create over one lakh new and sustainable livelihood opportunities in the next three years,” Ambani said.It will establish a Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the campus of a reputed university in UP, he said. ', 'Virat Kohli’s current purple patch has left a great many former players bedazzled and Sourav Ganguly, a great captain himself in his playing days, believes the 29-year-old’s run with the bat is unprecedented as far as Indian batsmen are concerned.On the ongoing tour of South Africa, Kohli first scored 286 runs in three Tests and then followed it up with 558 in six ODIs, including three tons. And then in the first T20 of a three-game rubber on Sunday, he scored 26, leaving him 130 runs short of becoming the second player after Viv Richards to score 1,000 international runs on a single tour.    And only on Tuesday, Kohli became the second batsman in the history of ICC rankings to cross the 900-point mark concurrently for both Tests and ODIs. It’s not hard to fathom why Ganguly speaks of Kohli’s batting in glowing terms. “Kohli is the flag bearer of Indian cricket. I have seen a lot of purple patches including mine, Dravid’s and Sachin Tendulkar’s. I genuinely believe that this is not just a purple patch for Kohli, this is genuine greatness,” Ganguly told India Today. He continued: “I have seen MS Dhoni captain, I have seen Rahul Dravid captain but I have never seen anyone perform this consistently with the bat as captain as Kohli has.”While India lost the Test series against Proteas 2-1, Ganguly is hopeful things will change as Kohli gets more and more experience as India captain in conditions totally different from the ones in the subcontinent. “Kohli has done brilliantly. Overseas Test series [not including the Indian subcontinent] wins will come – the only places he has captained India in full series are the West Indies and South Africa.“The next two series in Australia and England will define him as a captain. He has got the ability. The best thing he does as a captain is that he leads by example. Look at the hundreds he got against South Africa. For the two series against England and Australia, Kohli and the team needs to go early. Play a couple of side games before getting into the series,” Ganguly said.', 'Manila: A Philippine court has sentenced an Australian man to life imprisonment after finding him guilty on human trafficking and child pornography charges.Drew Frederick Shobbrook, 51, listened quietly as the verdict was read in a court in Cebu city on Tuesday. Footage shot by local broadcaster ABS-CBN of the proceedings showed Leslie Ann Fernandez, a Philippine national co-accused in the case, crying next to Shobbrook.Both were arrested during a 2013 operation in which 15 girls were rescued by Philippine authorities.According to the International Justice Mission, a global organization that partners with local authorities to fight human trafficking and child sexual abuse, Shobbrook used girls for pornographic images and videos that he then distributed online.Three victims testified at the trial that girls were also offered to other foreigners for sexual exploitation, according to the organization.Attorney John Tanagho of the IJM said the conviction sends a strong message to perpetrators of human trafficking for online sexual exploitation of children in the Philippines.“Whether someone is a foreigner or a Filipino, if they sexually abuse Filipino children online or by creating child pornography, then they will be held accountable,” Tanagho said.The IJM says there has been an increasing number of cases involving the online sexual exploitation of children in the Philippines, with the crime spreading as more people gain access to the internet. More than 80 percent of victims rescued from online sexual exploitation are minors.', 'New Delhi/Washington: Donald Trump Jr said Wednesday any talk that his family is profiting from his father’s presidency is “nonsense” as he embarked on a highly publicized visit to India to promote real estate deals that bear his family’s name.The eldest son of President Donald Trump is in India to meet the promoters and buyers of Trump brand luxury homes in the country, raising ethical concerns about using the name of the American president to promote business ventures internationally. But Trump Jr told Indian television channel CNBC-TV18 that his family is instead missing out on business opportunities because his father pledged to conduct no new foreign business while he was in office.Trump Jr, who along with his brother Eric now runs the Trump Organization, said when critics talk about them “profiteering from the presidency and all this nonsense” they forget about “the opportunity cost of the deals that we were not able to do.”“It’s sort of a shame. Because we put on all these impositions on ourselves and essentially got no credit for actually doing that … for doing the right thing,” he added.For at least a week before Trump Jr arrived in India on Tuesday, several major Indian newspapers carried glossy, front-page advertisements with the statement, “Trump has arrived. Have you?”The ads promised that buyers who order apartments in a new Trump-brand luxury real estate development in a suburb of the Indian capital by Thursday will get “a conversation and dinner” with Trump Jr a day later.He is expected to visit and promote business in all the Trump-brand projects across four Indian cities. Media access to his events in the country has been limited and only news organizations chosen by his team have had access to him.The Trump Organization has licensing agreements with all its Indian business partners. They build the properties and acquire the Trump name in exchange for a fee. With five projects in India, the country is the brand’s largest market outside the United States. A luxury complex is already open in the central city of Pune, with other developments in varying stages of construction in the coastal cities of Mumbai and Kolkata, and two in Gurgaon.All the projects were signed before President Trump took office, but promoting even existing business has raised ethics concerns.“The president should be putting the public’s interest before his business interests. That can’t happen if his son is flying around the world trying to trade on the fact that his father is sitting in the Oval Office,” said Scott H. Amey, general counsel for the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight in Washington.Amey added that several foreign deals touted by the president’s two adult sons have “stretched the definition of what ventures were previously in the works.”Trump Jr has made several visits to India over the years and has repeatedly talked of great business opportunities in the country.', 'Washington/Seoul: US Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to meet with North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, while in South Korea for the Winter Olympics in February but the North Koreans cancelled at the last minute, US officials said on Tuesday.“North Korea dangled a meeting in hopes of the Vice President softening his message, which would have ceded the world stage for their propaganda during the Olympics,” Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, said in a statement. But after Pence condemned North Korean human rights abuses and announced plans for new economic sanctions, “they walked away from a meeting or perhaps they were never sincere about sitting down,” Ayers said.Pence was going to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, and the nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam, but the North Koreans called off the February 10 meeting two hours before it was set to start, a US official said, confirming a story first reported by the Washington Post.The encounter would have been the first scheduled between senior officials from the Trump administration and Pyongyang, which are in a standoff over the North’s development of nuclear weapons capable of hitting the United States.“The President made a decision that if they wanted to talk, we would deliver our uncompromising message. If they asked for a meeting, we would meet. He also made clear that until they agreed to complete denuclearization we weren’t going to change any of our positions or negotiate,” Ayers said, echoing comments made by Pence since he left the Olympics and other US officials.“This administration will stand in the way of Kim’s desire to whitewash their murderous regime with nice photo ops at the Olympics. Perhaps that’s why they walked away from a meeting or perhaps they were never sincere about sitting down,” Ayers said in the statement.South Korea’s presidential Blue House said it had nothing to say on the matter.Pence had criticized Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions and announced the “toughest and most aggressive” sanctions against Pyongyang yet, while also moving to strengthen the US alliance with Japan and South Korea.Kim Jong Un, through his sister, invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Pyongyang to begin talks “soon.”South Korea’s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa told lawmakers on Wednesday that talks to improve inter-Korean relations had to go in hand with those linked to denuclearization of the North. Seoul was in close talks and cooperation with Washington regarding engagements with Pyongyang, the minister said.“Only when denuclearization moves forward can inter-Korean relations move forward,” said Kang, adding Washington’s role is “very important” in bringing North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions.Signs of a North-South thaw have prompted speculation that it could lead to direct talks between Washington and Pyongyang after months of tension and exchanges of insults between US President Donald Trump and Kim, fueling fears of war.North Korea has refrained from carrying out any weapons tests since late November, when it shot off its largest intercontinental ballistic missile. South Korea’s Unification Ministry declined to say on Wednesday whether North Korea has been engaging in its regular winter military exercises, which usually run from December for a few months.', 'New Delhi/Chennai: Customers of telecom service provider Aircel in Chennai are facing a tough time as they are rushing to apply for mobile number portability amidst reports of closure of the company’s servicesSome of the customers said they were neither able to make a call nor receive and they termed it as the first step towards total closure of services.Some complained that they were unable to use the mobile number porting facility due to network issues. Meanwhile, media reports are saying that Aircel is creating manual codes to facilitate porting requests as there has been a huge rise in demand of porting over the past few days.In Tamil Nadu, Aircel had about 20 million customers and as of September 30, 2017 and 88.8 million customers nationwide.Aircel has reportedly warned its employees to be ready for “difficult” times ahead in the wake of funding crunch that may lead the company to file for bankruptcy,  as per a financial daily report.Amidst intense competition in the market, the Maxis-owned telco’s operations has not been able to keep pace with rivals.A report in the Economic Times said that Aircel’s  chief executive officer Kaizad Heerjee, in an email to employees earlier this week,  said that the company has “no funding for some time” and has been dependent on “cash generation from its “current business operations”.The paper earlier this week reported that Aircel will soon file for bankruptcy at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).The board of the telecom company, which has a Rs 15,500 crore debt, has been dissolved ahead of the move. The application to the NCLT will be submitted within a few days.The decision has been reportedly taken following the Reserve Bank of India scrapping all debt revamp schemes in favour of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Since Aircel has not made payments since September, banks cannot restructure Aircel.Two weeks ago Idea Cellular suspended interconnect services with Aircel for non- payment of dues. Idea said it will restore interconnect services immediately after Aircel makes the payment, but did not specify the outstanding amount.Idea said that despite multiple reminders since November 2017, the operator had failed to meet its payment commitments forcing Idea to suspend interconnect services, as per the terms of interconnect agreement.Aircel and Reliance Communications had signed binding agreements in September 2016 for the merger of RCom’s mobile businesses with Aircel. However they terminated the deal in October last year for the “lapses with mutual consent.”', 'Focused adventurer\\nAfter Hero MotoCorp took the wraps off its much-awaited XPulse concept at EICMA 2017, it made its Indian debut at Auto Expo 2018. Taking the legacy of the Impulse forward, the XPulse comes with a sharper focus on off-road performance, thanks to its ground clearance, off-road tyres, wind protection and an accessible seat height.Functional design\\nThe fuel tank has pronounced knee recesses and gets a flush-fitting fuel tank cap. The bike has an upright, commanding stance and a one-piece seat that extends onto the fuel tank – an expected element on an enduro motorcycle. The engine on the vehicle shown at the Expo was shrouded with ample protection – a compact, functional-looking crash guard and a drilled underbelly bash plate. It’s interesting to note that Hero claims the XPulse has more ground clearance and suspension travel than the Impulse, which means it will probably be more capable off-road.Equipment\\nThe XPulse features a raised front fender and a round full-LED headlight that’s complemented by a windscreen. It gets an enduro-bike-styled handlebar and hand guards as well. Also on offer is a digital instrument console that gets a gear position indicator, distance-to-empty and more. The XPulse also has an underseat USB charger and Bluetooth connectivity, which has enabled features like turn-by-turn navigation assistance on the digital display.Underpinnings\\nThe single-downtube chassis featured on the XPulse makes use of a box-section swingarm and a monoshock rear suspension, as well as a smaller disc brake at the rear. This chassis is a new development and Hero says it has proved itself at the 2017 Raid de Himalaya rally where it was tested.The XPulse gets a 21-inch front wheel, a single-channel ABS and a telescopic fork with 190mm of travel. The rear, meanwhile, gets an 18-inch wheel and a monoshock with 170mm of wheel travel. These are the wheel sizes seen on proper off-road machines and are larger than the Impulse’s 19-inch front and 17-inch rear wheel sizes. Ground clearance is an impressive 220mm and a skid-plate will boost its ability to take a beating. At 825mm, the seat height is decent for the purpose, but it may feel a bit high for shorter riders. Hero says that the seat is quite narrow, which should make it easier to get both feet flat on the ground.Engine and availability\\nThe XPulse is powered by an 18.4hp, 200cc, single-cylinder, fuel-injected motor that it shares with the Xtreme 200R. However, on the XPulse, it is in a different state of tune and has sprockets. The bike will be available in either a fuel-injected or carburetted version, with the latter being the more affordable option. With a 14-litre fuel tank, the XPulse should offer a decent range. We expect it to be launched soon; though the bike showcased at the Auto Expo 2018 was not the production-spec version, it was quite close to it. Hero says it is targeting a price below the Rs 1 lakh (ex-showroom) mark.', 'Porsche has globally unveiled and launched its second-generation 911 GT3 RS in India, priced at Rs 2.75 crore (ex-showroom, India).The track-ready model gets a raft of performance tweaks to make it even faster than the GT3. The most prominent is the 520hp, 4.0-litre naturally aspirated flat-six engine. Power is up by 20hp compared to the standard GT3 thanks to new intake and exhaust systems, along with changes to Porsche’s DME (Digital Motor Electronics) engine management. Claimed 0-100 time is 0.1sec faster (at 3.2sec) and top speed is marginally more too at 312kph. The motor is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission as standard.The chassis modifications are similar to those seen on the GT2 RS and include an extensively reprogrammed rear-wheel steering system. The GT3 RS comes equipped with carbon fibre front wings and bonnet (with new NACA ducts to help brake cooling) and a magnesium roof. Speccing the optional Weissach Pack adds a carbon fibre roof and magnesium wheels. Buyers who specify the full pack will be able to shave 29kg of the 1460kg model.A Clubsport pack is also on offer that adds a roll-over bar, manual fire extinguisher, preparation for a battery-disconnect switch and six-point safety-harness at no extra cost. The standard 20-inch alloy wheels are shod in 265/35 rubber at the front and 325/30 tyres at the rear.The interiors now get carbon fibre-backed racing seats, lightweight door panels with storage nets and nylon opening loops. Other weight-saving measures include a reduction in sound absorption material and a lightweight engine lid for the rear-engine model.In India, the 911 GT3 RS is priced about Rs 44 lakh more than the standard 911 GT3, which rivals the likes of the Mercedes-AMG GT R.', 'New York: Modern humans have brains that are more than three times larger than our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, and we have the gradual increase in brain size of our ancestors over the past three million years to thank for that, a new study says.The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involved an analysis of 94 hominin fossils.It showed that brain size increased gradually and consistently, driven by evolution within populations, introduction of larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones.“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity, language, tool making and all these other things that make us unique,” said Andrew Du from the University of Chicago and first author of the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here,” Du added.The researchers compared published research data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13 different species, beginning with the earliest unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size began to overlap with that of modern-day humans.The researchers saw that when the species were counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a common ancestor, the average brain size increased gradually over three million years. The increase was driven by three different factors, primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within individual species populations, but also by the addition of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones, the study said.“The conventional wisdom was that our large brains had evolved because of a series of step-like increases each one making our ancestors smarter. Not surprisingly the reality is more complex, with no clear link between brain size and behaviour,” said Bernard Wood, Professor at George Washington University and senior author of the study.', 'New Delhi: Two new vaccines have shown promise in preventing tuberculosis, the world’s leading infectious disease killer, results of new clinical trials show.The findings showed that re-vaccination with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and an experimental vaccine candidate named as H4:IC31, were effective in preventing sustained infections in high-risk adolescents.Introduced in 1921, BCG is the only licensed tuberculosis vaccine available globally, while H4:IC31 is an investigative subunit vaccine candidate being developed. “We have demonstrated that (this) vaccination has the potential to reduce the rate of sustained tuberculosis infection in a high-transmission setting,” said lead author Mark Hatherill, Director of the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) at the University of Cape Town. “While neither vaccine proved to be statistically significant in preventing an initial tuberculosis infection, we are extremely encouraged by the signals observed for both vaccines in preventing sustained tuberculosis infections. “The results will provide significant scientific benefit to the field in understanding tuberculosis infection, and we look forward to testing the potential of such vaccines to prevent tuberculosis disease among uninfected adolescents,” Hatherill said.According to the Global TB Report 2017, released by the World Health Organisation (WHO), India continues to have the highest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the world.In 2016, there were an estimated 10.4 million new tuberculosis cases worldwide. Seven countries accounted for 64 per cent of the total burden, with India having the maximum number of tuberculosis patients, followed by Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa.In India, an estimated 27.9 lakh patients were suffering from tuberculosis in 2016 and up to 4.23 lakh patients were estimated to have died during the year, the report said. The study, presented at the Fifth Global Forum on TB Vaccines in New Delhi, involved 990 HIV-negative, healthy adolescents (12-17 years of age) who had been vaccinated as infants with BCG. All participants were randomised evenly into three study arms: placebo, H4:IC31, or BCG revaccination. The data showed that both vaccines appeared to be safe and produced an immune response in the adolescents studied. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.As per WHO, about one-third of the world’s population has what is called a latent tuberculosis infection, which means people have been infected by tuberculosis bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease. People infected with tuberculosis bacteria have a lifetime risk of falling ill with tuberculosis. People ill with tuberculosis can infect 10-15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. ', 'New Delhi: After shaking up the highly competitive Indian smartphone market, especially in the last two quarters of 2017, Chinese handset maker Xiaomi has kick-started the new year with two devices — Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro.While Redmi Note 5 is essentially a successor to last year’s immensely-popular Redmi Note 4, the “Pro” version is a more powerful device which is the world’s first to debut Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 chipset.Redmi Note 5 Pro is also the first Xiaomi smartphone to come with the “Face Unlock” feature.Both the smartphones have big shoes to fill as last year’s Redmi Note 4 became quite a game changer for Xiaomi, which sold over 9.6 million Note 4 devices last year.Let us see what Note 5 Pro (4GB RAM and 64GB onboard storage variant which costs Rs 13,999) has to offer.Weighing 181 grams, the device definitely is not light-weight, and it is sturdy enough to handle a few drops.The front of the device is similar to its smaller sibling Redmi Note 5, with prominent curved corners on display with 18:9 aspect ratio for immersive video and gaming experience.The slim bezels also makes the device sport a 5.99-inch full-HD+ display and occupy a smaller footprint when in the palm.The display of Note 5 Pro was bright and punchy with good sunlight legibility.A 20MP selfie camera with an aperture of f/2.2, selfie light flash, face-recognition feature and other sensors and earpiece are placed above the display, while on-screen navigation buttons sit below.The front camera did a good job of clicking selfies with enough detail in daylight conditions. The selfie light it uses is essentially diffused white light, which also helped capture selfies in very low-light conditions.The metal rear with matte finish makes it look like the Redmi Note 4. The slightly curved back metal body is done in typical Xiaomi style.The fingerprint sensor was comfortable to use while holding the phone and authentication was fast.The design language of the rear camera, with 12MP+5MP sensors, has been borrowed from the Apple iPhone X.The primary camera is pretty capable and we shot some stunning images with the device in daylight conditions. The dual camera is one of the biggest USPs of this smartphone.A hefty 4,000mAh battery fuels Redmi Note 5 Pro that easily lasted us almost two days, with moderate to slightly heavy usage, including browsing videos and running multiple social media apps.The 4GB RAM variant did not show signs of warming albeit for a few gaming instances.What does not work?The primary camera’s performance was good although we found the portrait shots were less neat than what we saw with the Xiaomi Mi A1 (Rs 14,999).It is disappointing to see Xiaomi ship Redmi Note 5 Pro with Android 7 Nougat Operating System (OS) while the latest Android “Oreo” OS is in high demand.The phone’s ultra-wide display makes it a bit difficult to handle with one hand.The rear camera module’s visible protrusion makes the device wobbly when placed on a flat surface.The device also lacks a USB Type-C charging port.Conclusion: The good battery performance and improved cameras give Redmi 5 Pro an edge over its rivals such as Honor 9i in the market. The smartphone is for the people who are looking for a high-performance device with ample battery life.', 'New Delhi: To help advertisers and content creators reach out to Internet users in Tamil, Google India on Wednesday introduced Tamil language support for its advertising products Google “AdWords” and Google “AdSense”.With this, Google has now scaled support for three languages — Hindi, Bengali and Tamil.“Majority of India’s Internet users are not fluent in English and we have been very focussed on enabling Indian language support across our key products to make the Internet more useful for everyone,” Shalini Girish, Director, Google Marketing Solutions, Google India, said in a statement.“With the launch of Tamil support in our advertising products, we are enabling both the content creators and advertisers to connect with the Indian language users in their languages,” Girish added.The support for Tamil language will also let content creators (who have websites and blogs in Tamil) to sign up for Google “Adsense” and run ads on their content and attract advertisers from across the globe.“We saw a huge acceleration in Hindi content creation when we launched support for Hindi language and we hope that the addition of new languages will provide the necessary boost to content creation in local languages and grow digital advertising,” Girish added.India has 234 million Indian language users who are online as compared to 175 million English web users.According to the search engine giant, another 300 million Indian language users will come online in the next four years.', 'Chennai: A 22-year-old college student was stabbed in broad daylight by her estranged boyfriend at Anna Nagar Tower Park on Tuesday afternoon, much to the shock of the public gathered there. The assailant identified as N Rajesh (23) is an electrical engineer and he too attempted suicide by slashing himself with the knife, police sources said.The victim is pursuing a post-graduation degree in Mathematics at a private college in the city. She suffered six cut injuries on her torso-on the chest, right shoulder and abdomen while the boy has injuries on his chest and stomach. Both of them are undergoing treatment at a private hospital. Police investigations revealed that the two of them had decided to meet at the park to end their relationship. Another friend from college accompanied the victim. The woman and Rajesh were talking and when she stood up to leave, Rajesh intercepted her and then attacked her with a knife he was carrying and later hurt himself too, a police officer said. Hearing the cries of the woman, public in the park rushed to the scene and rescued the duo, who had cut injuries on their body and were bleeding profusely. The victim is a resident of Red Hills while the attacker, Rajesh is a resident of Ponneri. The two of them had known each other since class nine when they studied in the same school, police said. While Rajesh went on to pursue an engineering degree at a Coimbatore college, Ramya continued her education in the city. Rajesh was working in Coimbatore and the duo had decided to meet for one last time to end the relationship when the incident happened, police said.

The ‘Kaabil’ actor is currently busy in the first shooting schedule of the forthcoming film.According to a report in DNA, the unit will move to Mumbai and a whopping Rs 10-crore set is being erected at a suburban studio where a major portion of the film is likely to be shot. The reason behind this is the unbearable hot climate in Bihar which will get worse once summer starts. The makers of ‘Super 30’ decided that Hrithik, who is playing a lead role, will be comfortable shooting in an air-conditioned set in Mumbai. The film is reportedly based on the life story of Anand Kumar, who hails from Bihar. Anand trains 30 deserving and economically backward students for the most prestigious exams of IIT each year with a commendable success rate.In the recent interview, Anand expressed his happiness over the fact that Hrithik is essaying his life on a big screen. He had said, “I was delighted and pleasantly surprised to see the first look wherein Hrithik sports a rugged, bearded look. I had been told that at present the shooting was being done of my college days. I took out an old photograph of mine, of the time when I was studying at Patna University. I found the resemblance to be uncanny.”Directed by ‘Queen’ fame Vikas Bahl, ‘Super 30’ is expected to release later this year.', 'Hyderabad: Falaknuma police team that had gone to Kerala to serve notice to director of Malayalam movie ‘Oru Adaar Love’ will return following the Supreme Court order. The SC on Wednesday stayed all criminal proceedings against actor Priya Prakash Varrier and others associated with the film.An FIR was registered by the Falaknuma police, following a complaint made by Muqeed Khan, an engineering student. In his complaint, Muqeed had alleged that the Malayalam song “Manikya Malaraya Poovi”, filmed on Priya Prakash Varrier and Abdul Raouf mentions the relationship of Prophet Mohammed and his wife Bibi Khatija. He had complained that the manner in which the song was pictured had hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslim community.  “Falaknuma police team, headed by sub-inspector Ramakrishna is in Thrissur. We have called back the team. They had not served the notice so far and we will take a decision after examining the Supreme Court order. Legal advice is being sought,” DCP (south) V. Satyanarayana said. He clarified that the FIR at Falaknuma police station was registered against the director of the film Omar Lulu and not against actress Priya Prakash Varrier.After registering a case, the Falaknuma police had sent a notice through registered post to the director. A police team had also left for Thrissur three days ago to serve the notice in person to the director, said Falaknuma inspector, P. Yadagiri.A complaint was made at the Kamatipura police station in the Old City by another Muslim organisation. The police had made a general diary entry. Legal experts said that following the Supreme Court order, the police cannot proceed further in the case. ', 'WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump suggested on Wednesday that arming teachers could help prevent massacres such as last week’s mass shooting at a Florida high school.Trump voiced support for the idea during an emotional White House meeting with students who survived the shooting and a parent whose child did not.“If you had a teacher … who was adept at firearms, it could very well end the attack very quickly,” said Trump, who acknowledged the idea would be controversial.He sat in the middle of a semi-circle in the State Dining Room of the White House, listening intently as students wept and pleaded for change. He vowed to take steps to improve background checks for gun buyers.The meeting included six students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 students and educators were slain on Feb. 14 by a gunman with an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle in the second-deadliest shooting at a U.S. public school.“I don`t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war, an AR,” said Sam Zeif, 18, sobbing after he described texting his family members during the Florida shooting.\\n“Let`s never let this happen again please, please,” Zeif said.Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow Pollack, 18, was killed, shouted: “It should have been one school shooting and we should have fixed it. And I`m pissed – because my daughter – I`m not going to see again.” Trump said his administration would emphasize background checks and mental health in an effort to make schools safer.“We`re going to be very strong on background checks, we`re doing very strong background checks, very strong emphasis on the mental health,” Trump said.“It`s not going to be talk like it has been in the past,” Trump said.Trump`s support for any tightening of gun laws would mark a change for the Republican, who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association gun rights group during the 2016 presidential campaign.', 'Washington: President Donald Trump on Tuesday denied allegations by a former receptionist that he had kissed her without her consent in an elevator lobby of Trump Tower, calling the story “another false accusation.”Trump was reacting to a front-page report in The Washington Post on how Rachel Crooks, who first made the allegations public before the 2016 elections, has doggedly continued to stand by her story in public appearances, despite not knowing if it will ever make any difference. Crooks says that in 2006, when she was a 22-year-old receptionist working for an investment firm located in Trump Tower, she  introduced herself to the then 59-year-old real estate tycoon as he waited for an elevator outside her office.She said she approached him with her hand out, and he grabbed it and started kissing her.“He started kissing me on one cheek, then the other cheek,” the newspaper quoted her as telling a group of women. “He was talking to me in between kisses, asking where I was from, or if I wanted to be a model. He wouldn’t let go of my hand, and then he went right in and started kissing me on the lips.”She said the incident lasted around two minutes.Trump hit back at the allegations on Twitter, saying, “A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet!) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened!”“Who would do this in a public space with live security cameras running,” he added, asking why The Washington Post had not reported “the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me?”Nineteen women have come forward to accuse the president of sexual misconduct over a period of several decades. Trump’s angry denials on Twitter have often served only to exacerbate the debate over his behaviour towards women.', 'Canberra: Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull heads to the United States on Wednesday, accompanied by the largest Australian political and business delegation ever to visit the USPresident Donald Trump’s softening opposition to joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership will be up for discussion when he meets Turnbull at the White House on Friday. The trade deal among 11 countries includes Australia, which also has a bilateral free trade partnership with the United States.Turnbull, a wealthy 63-year-old former Goldman Sachs partner, sees himself as having a lot in common with Trump, as they are both successful businessmen who entered politics relatively late in life.Security risks in the Asia-Pacific region created by a more assertive China and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions will also be on the agenda.Turnbull will be seeking a clear picture from Trump on how he expects the North Korean crisis to unfold, said Kim Beazley, a former Australian defense minister who was ambassador to Washington until 2016.“Generally speaking, when an Australian prime minister meets an American president, the globe is traversed, all sorts of things, the commitments we have in common, where we’re going to go in Iraq and all the rest of it,” Beazley told Australian Broadcasting Corp.“The difficulty facing Mr. Turnbull is nobody can be absolutely sure how the current president engages on any of those fronts,” Beazley added.While in Washington, Turnbull will address the US National Governors’ Association.Trade Minister Steven Ciobo said the most significant Australian political and business delegation to ever visit the United States signified the strength of the bilateral relationship.The United States is Australia’s most important security partner, while China is Australia’s biggest trading partner. Australia attempts to avoid taking sides in US and Chinese rivalry.A recent Australian foreign policy statement and the US National Defense Strategy both view China and Russia as potential threats to global security.Trump and Turnbull both dismiss speculation that their relationship had been damaged by their first, terse telephone conversation as national leaders last year in which the president reluctantly agreed to honor an Obama administration deal to resettle up to 1,250 refugees that Australia had rejected.Turnbull has since met Trump in New York, but the Washington meeting will be their first in the context of an official state visit.Two-way trade between the United States and Australia was USD 52 billion and growing last year, with the United States enjoying a trade surplus, according to Australian government figures.', 'NEW DELHI: Soon after General Bipin Rawat spoke on the rise of Maulana Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF (All India United Democratic Front) in Assam, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has cautioned the Army chief against speaking on political matters. Owaisi asserted that it is not the work of the Army chief work to comment on the rise of a political party.“Democracy & Constitution allows it and Army will always work under an Elected  Civilian leadership,” Owaisi said in a tweet on Wednesday.What,the Army Chief should not interfere in political matters it is not his work to comment on the rise of a political party ,Democracy & Constitution allows it and Army will always work under an Elected  Civilian leadership https://t.co/PacWqqYXz1— Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) February 22, 2018Referring to reports of an increase in Muslim population in several districts of Assam, the Army Chief had on Wednesday spoken about the Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF, observing that its growth has been “faster” than that of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 1980s. “There is a party called AIUDF. If you look at it, they have grown in a faster time-frame than the BJP grew over the years,” he said, while referring to the BJP winning only 2 seats in 1984. “The AIDUF is moving at a faster pace in Assam.”“A planned immigration is taking place because of our western neighbour. They will always try and ensure that this area is taken over, playing the proxy dimension of warfare,” General Rawat had said, talking about the influx of people from Bangladesh into the Northeast.He was addressing a conference on bridging gaps and securing borders in the Northeast region.The influx of illegal Bangladeshis is a major issue in Assam and the state government is coming out with a national register of citizens to find out those living illegally in the state.', 'Washington: America’s bilateral trade deficit with four major countries, including India, narrowed in the first three quarters of 2017 as compared to the previous year, the US administration said in a report according to which India’s growth has slowed due to the effects of its structural economic reforms.The Economic Report of the President (ERP) that shows a path for continued growth and paints a rosy picture for the American economy, alleges that countries, including India and Brazil – both GATT signatories since 1948 – have been far less open, preserving high bound rates and avoiding universal binding coverage.“Growth in India has slowed due to the effects of its structural economic reforms. India’s demonetisation of large-denomination notes in November 2016 invalidated 86 per cent of the cash in circulation in an economy where more than 90 per cent of transactions were cash-based,” it said.“The introduction in July 2017 of a single, country-wide sales tax replaced a vast number of different state and local tax rates, and has created short-term uncertainty,” the report noted.The report expressed concern over increasing share of non-performing loans (NPLs) in India’s banking sector, which it said poses further risks.According to country-sourced statistics provided to the IMF, NPLs as a share of all loans (i.E. NPL slippage ratio) in India stood at 9.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, compared with 1.7 per cent in China (IMF 2017).“NPLs have increased at an alarming rate in recent years, with the current NPL slippage ratio in India almost double that in FY 2014/15 (IMF 2017b). Public sector banks, with the State Bank of India as a leading example, account for the lion’s share of NPLs in the banking sector,” it said.The Reserve Bank of India predicts that gross NPLs as a proportion of all loans will increase to 10.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, and to 11. 1 per cent by September 2018.“However, the stress of India’s banking sector may be ameliorated in the future, given that the government recently announced a USD 32.4 billion package to recapitalise publicly- owned banks,” the report said.Noting that India has been the most frequent user of anti-dumping measures, the White House said delays in the approval of agricultural products derived from biotechnology in China, the EU, India, and other countries result in increased market uncertainty among technology providers, farmers, and traders of US corn, soy, cotton, and alfalfa—leading to reduced exports of these products.The Trump administration also blamed India for not implementing the WTO ruling on poultry.“India has failed to revise its requirements for poultry in a manner that would allow for US imports, and the case continues to be litigated in the WTO,” it said.“Since 2007, India has restricted various US agricultural products, including poultry meat, eggs, and live pigs, supposedly to prevent the entry of avian influenza into India,” the report said.The US has maintained that no scientific basis supports the ban.In March 2012, the US initiated a WTO dispute by requesting consultations with India.In emerging and developing economies, such as Brazil, China, India, Russia, and certain other countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, strengthening the external environment continues to help output growth recover.“There are, however, certain risks to future growth. As monetary policy normalises with higher interest rates in advanced economies, emerging and developing economies could face an outflow of capital,” it said.“Financial stability risks are also increasing due to the increase in nonperforming loans on the private sector balance sheets of two of the biggest and fastest-growing emerging market economies – China and India. Credit growth in China has arguably also become excessive, as it continues to shift from growth led by exports and investment to an economy led by internal demand,” it said. ', 'Madurai: Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan on Wednesday said the six ‘enjoining hands’ symbol of his new political party ‘Makkal Needhi Maiam’ represents six southern states.While speaking at the launch of the party, for which Haasan has “picked ideologies from everyone”, the politician said he had kept his party’s name ‘Maiam’ (Centre) because he did not belong to either Left or Right. The six southern states Haasan was talking about are Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and one Union Territory Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“People ask me what is Maiam, and if I am a Left or a Right. This is why I have kept my party’s name ‘Maiam’, which means centre. The six hands in my party symbol represent six states and the star in the middle represents people,” Haasan said.He said his party would work on providing quality education to all and diminishing caste and religion difference in the society.“We will work on many issues including these. We will set an example; fight corruption together. People have unfortunately sold their votes for merely Rs 6,000. People ask me if I will give them money. My answer is no, I will not. If you accept money, you cannot ask your representative for anything,” he said.Haasan said all these years he was in people’s heart and now he wants to be a part of their residence, “I am the lamp in your house, which does not flicker in winds of corruption.”When asked who his inspiration is — Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi or Periyar EV Ramasamy, the former actor said he liked and was inspired from all, including Arvind Kejriwal, N Chandrababu Naidu, Pinarayi Vijayan, and Barack Obama.Haasan said he wanted to start his party silently and move slowly towards campaigning.“There is no starvation for money, but for good-hearted people.”On the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Cauvery dispute, Haasan said Tamil Nadu could get water if there was good dialogue with Karnataka. “I can even get blood (donated blood, not violence).”He said his two daughters – Shruti Haasan and Akshara Haasan, who were present at the launch event, were free to decide whether to join him in this new journey or not.', '“How fast is the Internet?” — this is one question that every smartphone user in the current times is habituated to. The speed of Internet dictates a lot of people’s lives, which clearly indicates how important is it for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to deliver fast and reliable connections across the length and breadth of the country. Not long ago, India got to see the benefits of ultra-fast 4G LTE Internet connections — courtesy Reliance Jio. Since then, a lot of players stepped up the game to provide fast and reliable Internet connections with tempting data plans. So, has the new technology changed the perception of India being one of the countries with the slowest Internet connections? Probably not.In a recent survey by OpenSignal on the state of LTE around the world, Indian hasn’t fared well when it comes to Internet speeds. Out of a total of 77 countries where 4G LTE Internet is present and working, India presently ranks at 77th position, i.e. last on the list. With an average speed of 6.13Mbps, India is sitting at bottom of the table. The United States of America (USA) also fares pretty low with an average speed of 13.98Mbps. The country that leads the table is Singapore, with an average LTE speed of 46.64Mbps. When it comes to availability of 4G on India gains back positions considerably. Out of the 77 countries, India presently sits as the 11th position with 84.03 per cent. South Korea leads the list with a total reach of 96.69 per cent, followed by Japan at 94.11 per cent and Norway at 88.66 per cent. This is a pretty impressive score for India, considering the country’s massive expanse.However, what’s surprising that no country has managed to touch the elusive 50Mbps mark, which is something that a 4G LTE network promised to bring. As for India, Reliance Jio made 4G LTE network more accessible initially with a free-to-use model and following it up later with extremely affordable data plans. Vodafone, Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular are some of the other prominent names in the 4G category in the Indian smartphone market.Over the past few months, all of the aforementioned telecom operators have been trying to enjoy a pie of Reliance Jio’s profits by offering super sweet deals and offers. Jio itself has been fighting back with lucrative deals on all its data plans. While all of them have been able to draw in more subscribers to the new technology, the availability of high-speed Internet at extremely affordable rates is causing a lot of network congestion, which results in average lower Internet speeds. However, even at 6.13Mbps, the speeds can be at best termed as decent when compared to even lower average speeds of the older 3G and obsolete 2G networks. The lower Internet speeds are due to the fact that telecom operators have to cover a vast expanse of the country, which is a tough job at the initial stages of widespread 4G deployment.However, telecom operators are trying to capture more consumers in 4G LTE’s coverage and we expect them to keep trying to improve the numbers while keeping the Internet accessible to everyone.', 'Salem: Hadiya, the 24-year-old woman who made headlines after she converted to Islam, on Tuesday  told the Supreme Court that her mother used to drug her food when she was in the custody of her parents in Kerala’s Kottayam district.In an affidavit filed in the SC on Tuesday, Hadiya sought permission to remain as Shafin Jahan’s wife. She also stated that she is a Muslim and wanted to remain as a Muslim.According to a report in India Today, Hadiya claimed that her mother used to drug her food during her stay at home after the Kerala High Court annulled her marriage to Shafin Jahan. She said she had repeatedly informed the police about her mother drugging the food which she took while breaking the fast during Ramzan, but no action was taken.“It was my mother who used to prepare food for me for breaking my fast. One day at the time of breakfast, my mother went to the kitchen and tried to bring food for me. I came out from my room and proceeded to the kitchen in order to take food from my mother. She did not notice my presence. When I reached the kitchen, I saw my mother was doing something unusual with the food prepared for me and the same startled me,” her affidavit stated according to India Today report.“I thereafter, informed the police about my mothers deed. But they were reluctant to hear me or to take any step to resolve the issue. On that day onwards, I began to prepare food for myself. The inaction of the police reminded me that the police would not question whatever crimes take place against me,” she further said.She said after the Kerala High Court annulled the marriage, she was subjected to horrible torture and torment for a period of more one year.  She was under police surveillance and the National Investigation Agency treated her as a terrorist.\\nShe said she decided on her own free will to accept Islam as her faith and religion, because Islam impressed her.Also Read: Kerala love jihad: I’m Muslim, want to remain as Jahan’s wife, Hadiya tells SCIn a recent verdict on the Kerala ‘love jihad’ case in January this year, the Supreme Court declared that an adult woman has the right to live freely and choose a life of her choice.The Supreme Court said the NIA could continue with its probe into the alleged love jihad case of Kerala but it cannot investigate the marital status of the man and the woman.Akhila had married a Muslim man called Shafin, embraced Islam and changed her name to Hadiya.', 'New Delhi: The fraud at the Punjab National Bank (PNB) without doubt raises questions about the quality of auditing in India. Following this failure of the audit system at PNB’s Mumbai branch for seven years, the government is planning to notify the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA).Sources close to the development told Zee Business that NFRA will be notified soon. After notification, the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) will be the body that will regulate chartered accountants in the country and set standards for their functioning. In the case where professional or other misconduct in auditing is proved, stringent penalty provisions have been proposed under NFRA. In case of individuals, the penalty will not be less than one lakh rupees, but it may extend to five times of the fraudulent amount. For audit firms, the penalty could be between ten lakh rupees and exceed up to ten times of the fees received.At present, the penalty imposed for misconduct by auditors is one lakh rupees.In addition, the individual or the firm will be debarred from engaging himself/itself from practising as a member of the Institute of Chartered Account of India for a minimum period of six months or for a higher period not exceeding ten years.At present, auditors are regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), which was set up under Section 28A of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. The act has mandated the body to conduct independent audit quality reviews.Creation of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) was proposed in Companies Act 2013, but the body never came into existence. It was proposed for the establishment and enforcement of accounting and auditing standards and oversight of the work of auditors.', 'SEVILLE: Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea added another heart-stopping save to his collection as his team held a highly-impressive Sevilla side to a 0-0 draw away from home in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Wednesday.The Spain international foiled Colombian striker Luis Muriel from point-blank range at the end of the first half not long after tipping over an overhead kick from Argentine defender Gabriel Mercado as the Spaniards created far more chances than Jose Mourinho`s side.United forward Romelu Lukaku spurned a rare clear opening in the first period when he punted a pass from Alexis Sanchez well over the bar and the Belgian had a goal ruled out for handball late in the second. Sevilla fired 25 shots at De Gea`s goal while United only had six attempts, only one of which was on target. United coach Jose Mourinho, however, said he did not feel his side had been fortunate to leave Spain with the tie still wide open.“No, I’m not relieved. I think we finished the game with more space than we had in the beginning, with more chances of scoring the goal,” he told a news conference. “The stats are what they are. Sometimes you have 15 shots, but 13 of them were what I call statistic shots. So I really feel the result reflects what the game was like. If you ask me is it a good result, I say it is not good, it is not bad.”The second leg takes place at Old Trafford on March 13, where United will be looking to reach the last eight of the competition for the first time since 2014, with Sevilla hoping finally to get past the last-16 barrier they have failed to overcome in three previous attempts.More scrutiny Mourinho`s relationship with Paul Pogba was left open to more scrutiny when the Portuguese left his record signing out of the starting lineup, although he threw on the France midfielder when Ander Herrera pulled up injured early in the game.Pogba did not manage to answer his many recent critics, who have questioned his influence over the last two months. He was unable to engineer many attacks and sent a long, hopeful shot well wide of goal in the second half.United`s latest high-profile signing, Alexis Sanchez, also had a night to forget in his first European game for the club since joining from Arsenal in January as he saw little of the ball and was hauled off for Marcus Rashford in the 75th minute.Muriel paid tribute to De Gea for denying him and said he was disappointed his side did not take their chances. “He moved his body well, I could have hit it in the corner but I went for power over placement and he`s a great goalkeeper,” Muriel said.“When you play matches like this the key is scoring in these little chances like that, but in general the team played very well. We played exactly as you should: we were disciplined in every stage of the game but we leave here feeling a little bitter that we couldn`t score.”', 'KHARKIV: Shakhtar Donetsk`s South American blend proved too strong for AS Roma as goals from Facundo Ferreyra and Fred gave them a 2-1 win in a Champions League tie played in freezing conditions on Wednesday.The Serie A team appeared to be coasting in the round-of-16 first-leg tie when Cengiz Under put them ahead with his fifth goal in four games four minutes before halftime. Yet as the temperature dipped towards minus-nine Celsius, Argentine striker Ferreyra took advantage of poor Roma defending to score with an expertly-taken goal in the 52nd minute.That turned the game on its head and it was no surprise when Brazilian midfielder Fred curled in a free kick off the underside of the crossbar to stun the visitors in the 71st minute. “The team performed well in the second half,” said Shakhtar`s Portuguese coach Paulo Fonseca, whose side reached the knockout stage at the expense of Roma`s fellow Italians Napoli.“It wasn’t easy to keep up that pace after a long winter break. The only reason we didn`t win by a bigger margin was a brilliant display from the Roma keeper.” Shakhtar, the first team to beat English Premier League leaders Manchester City this season, began with six South American-born players in their lineup, though one of them, Marlos, now plays for Ukraine.The Pitmen, playing only their second competitive game since a two-month winter break, were on the back foot in the first half and goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov made a double save from Edin Dzeko and Federico Fazio from one of several Roma corners.Dzeko wasted another attack with a tame shot at Pyatov but made amends by setting up Roma`s goal in the 41st minute. The Bosnian threaded a clever ball inside Ismaily to Under and, although Pyatov got a hand to the Turk`s shot, he could not prevent it ending up in the net.The Italian side looked comfortable after the break, as well, but the game turned in the 52nd minute when Shakhtar scored out of the blue. Yaroslav Rakitskiy played a long ball out of defence which Alessandro Florenzi lunged at but failed to cut out, allowing Ferrerya to break away.The Argentine took his chance with aplomb, cutting inside Kostas Manolas to slot the ball past Roma keeper Alisson. Shakhtar took control and Alisson made superb saves from Marlos and Taison before he was beaten by a brilliant free kick from fellow Brazilian Fred, who sent a looping shot over the wall and in off the crossbar.Yet in stoppage time Alisson made a save to keep out another Ferreyra effort, which could yet prove crucial. Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco was furious at his team`s second-half display. “We committed too many schoolboy errors from players who are very experienced,” he said. “My team lacks the ability to maintain momentum and perform when they get into difficulties.”', 'The 488 Pista is a more powerful, lighter variant of the 488 GTB, just as the 458 Speciale was to the 458. The newcomer dispatches the 0-100kph benchmark with an impressive time of 2.85sec. The official quoted figure for the Italian carmaker’s halo model, LaFerrari, is “under 3.0sec”.The model uses the most powerful V8 in Ferrari’s history and is described as an “extreme evolution” of the turbo unit that won International Engine of the Year in both 2016 and 2017. The Pista’s 3.9-litre twin-turbo engine produces 721hp at 8,000rpm and 770Nm of torque at 3,000rpm. Its top speed is up to 340kph. Performance figures from its key rival – the range-topping Porsche 911 GT2 RS – are near-identical, achieving 0-100kph in 2.8sec and a matching top speed of 340kph.Ferrari claims the 488 Pista is “a significant step forward” from the previous special series in terms of sporty dynamics and the level of technology carried over from racing. The name – the Italian word for ‘track’ – is a nod to the brand’s motorsport heritage.The engine, vehicle dynamics, weight-saving and aerodynamics are all derived from the 488 GTE and 488 Challenge race cars. Ferrari says that the result is a car that offers track-like performance on the road and on circuits. The 488 Challenge also supplies the Pista’s turbos with integrated rev sensors, while the air intake line has been moved from the flanks to the rear spoiler so as to help achieve better airflow. The car’s torque is higher than the 488 GTB’s at all engine speeds, and the quality and intensity of the engine sound, Ferrari says, are higher than the 488 GTB in all gears and at all revs.The dry weight is 90kg less than a standard 488 GTB’s, at 1,280kg. In addition, an extra 50hp in engine power has ensured this to be Ferrari’s most powerful V8 yet. The decrease in weight comes from features used on the 488 Challenge. These include Inconel exhaust manifolds and a lightweight crankshaft and flywheel; as well as titanium con-rods and carbon-fibre intake plenums.Ferrari has also updated its Slideslip Angle Control system, which was first seen on the 458 Speciale. It offers advanced stability control, akin to a drift mode. The car uses Ferrari’s magnetorheological suspension set-up. The Pista will be available with 20-inch carbon-fibre wheel rims – a first for Ferrari. Other carbon-fibre parts on the car include the engine cover, bumpers and rear spoiler.Overall, there is a 20 percent improvement in downforce, according to Ferrari. The Pista has an F1-inspired S-duct and redesigned front and rear diffusers from the 488 GTE.The arrival of the 488 Pista, which has been rumoured for many weeks, follows in the footsteps of models such as the 458 Speciale, 430 Scuderia and 360 Stradale – all considered the halo variants for their respective models. None was a limited-production model but was typically in production for only two or three years.The Ferrari 488 Pista will officially debut at the Geneva motor show, in March.History of the GTO:\\nAlthough the Ferrari 250 GTO was the first to receive the GTO moniker, it was the 288 GTO – known simply as the GTO – which began an era of creating more powerful, lighter versions of existing Ferrari road cars, an ethos that has continued to this day with the 488 Pista.The Ferrari GTO was built to race but due to poor participation in the race series, it never did; and all 272 cars built were only ever used on road. Enzo Ferrari gifted the last-built GTO to Formula 1 legend, Niki Lauda.

We have plenty of them. We need skilled midwives,” the Associated Press (AP) quoted him saying.The report which is a part of UNICEF’s new campaign showed that South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as the worst places for a child to be born.The report further said that after Pakistan, the Central African Republic is the next riskiest country for newborns, and Afghanistan is the third.“Babies born in Japan, Iceland, and Singapore have the best chance at survival, while newborns in Pakistan, the Central African Republic and Afghanistan face the worst odds,” it said, noting that “more than 80 percent of all newborn deaths are caused by three preventable and treatable conditions,” the AP reported.UNICEF says as many as 3 million children could be saved each year with an investment in quality care at delivery.In Pakistan, Dr. Khalid said 80 percent of newborn deaths could be prevented with skilled birth attendants.The UN children’s agency also appealed on properly training midwives and allowing better “access to well-trained midwives, along with proven solutions like clean water, disinfectants, breastfeeding within the first hour, skin-to-skin contact and good nutrition.”According to the AP report, Khalid, who has conducted extensive research into mother and child health and has written international papers on the subject, said that lack of funding, corruption, and misplaced government priorities all contribute to insufficient investments in the training of midwives.', 'New Delhi: Director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan is happy that his controversial Malayalam film “S Durga” has been passed by the CBFC Revising Committee.

Hope that the film will be released in India soon,” Sasidharan tweeted on Wednesday along with the film’s poster that reads “S Coming, S Durga”.“S Durga” was dropped from a jury-suggested shortlist of the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India along with another film “Nude”, triggering controversy last year.The director got caught in a long-drawn battle with the IFFI organisers to screen his movie and even moved the Kerala High Court in November.“They (CBFC) wanted to re-examine my film. I was told that there was manipulation in the title of the film. I went to the court. The court asked CBFC to clear the film if I was ready to release the film as ‘S Durga’ instead of ‘Sexy Durga’,” Sasidharan told IANS.“I was okay with ‘S Durga’ as earlier when I had applied to censor board, I was told to change the name. I had agreed to it. Now, after re-examination, they have found nothing objectionable. They cleared the film without any fresh cuts.“It has received a ‘U/A’ certificate. The producer (Shaji Mathew) needs to file an affidavit saying that he will only screen the film as ‘S Durga’ and only ‘S Durga’ would be used in the promotion or poster of the film,” he added.Internationally, the film is titled “Sexy Durga”.“International rights have been already sold. It’s in India, that I can’t use the name as the censor board has a problem with it. But there is nothing against Goddess Durga. I am tired of repeating this 100 times.“It is about the society. People need to watch the film and then only they will understand and can form an opinion,” said the director.He is planning to release the film across the country soon.“We are trying to release it pan-India. Discussions are going on. Hopefully, by end of March or beginning of April, it will release. There are already subtitles. The film is not really dialogue oriented.

Yes, Google will unveil the Android Go branded devices at the MWC 2018, with sales starting thereafter.In one of their recent blog posts, Google has mentioned the availability of the Android Oreo Go Edition devices by the next week, which indicates Google will be using the MWC as a platform to reach out to the world. Android Oreo Go was released in December 2017 and aimed to make Android smartphones more affordable and accessible, with indicated prices below the $50 mark (under Rs 3,000).Android Go is built to make Google’s version of Android reach to the masses. An Android Go device may have 1GB of RAM, or less, which is beneficial for manufacturers to keep the prices of the smartphones extremely affordable. The first Android to get the Go treatment is Android Oreo, which has been tweaked to sip on system resources as efficiently as possible, without running the Android experience. Android Oreo (Go edition) will also bring with itself a toned-down version of PlayStore that will recommend suitable apps and services for the user. The Go smartphones will also come with optimised Go-branded Google apps such as Gmail Go, YouTube Go, Google Go, Assistant (Go edition), Maps Go and Files Go.According to several rumours, Micromax is supposed to be one of the first manufacturers to embrace the Android Go program by launching relatively cheaper Android smartphones. If that rumour becomes true, then we could be seeing Micromax’s ultra-affordable smartphones at the MWC next week, with these devices going on sale the week later. Nokia’s Android Oreo Go powered Nokia 1 could also be unveiled alongside.Apart from that, Google has also stated that their Android One platform will gain some new partners. If you recall, Nokia’s rumoured Android One device, expected to be called the Nokia 7 Plus, would break covers after teasing the world for the last few weeks. The Android One program was boosted last year with the arrival global manufacturers such as Xiaomi, Motorola, HTC and some others.', 'New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Thursday seized mutual funds and shares worth Rs 100 crores of the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi groups in connection with its money-laundering probe into the case. It also seized nine high-end luxury cars of Modi. As the searches at the groups’ premises continued for the eighth day by ED, the income-tax department said property worth Rs 1,200 crores of the Gitanjali Group located in the Special Economic Zone in Hyderabad has been attached. ED sources said the agency had seized mutual funds and shares worth Rs 86.72 crores belong to Choksi and his group, and the rest are owned by the Modi group. Choksi is Modi’s uncle and promoter of Gitanjali Gems and other jewellery brands.The probe agency also seized nine costly cars of Modi, recovered during raids last week. These include a Rolls Royce Ghost, a Mercedes-Benz, a Porsche Panamera, three Honda variants, a Toyota Fortuner and an Innova. Modi, Choksi and others are being investigated by multiple probe agencies after it came to light, following a PNB complaint, that they had allegedly cheated the nationalised bank of Rs 11,400 crores, with the purported involvement of a few employees of the bank. Meanwhile, the Punjab National Bank on Thursday asked disgraced diamond jeweller Nirav Modi to come up with a “concrete and implementable” plan to settle the Rs 11,400-crore loss caused to it by the fraudulent issuance of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) through one of its Mumbai branches. Nirav Modi, who is under the scanner of various investigative agencies, failed to depose before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning on Thursday. ED sources said a fresh summons was issued against Modi after he failed to appear and depose before the agency. They added that Modi had replied to the ED’s investigating officer (IO), who is probing the role of the diamond merchant and his uncle Mehul Choksi, Gitanjali Gems’ promoter, in the PNB fraud case, and cited the temporary suspension of his passport and pending business issues as reasons for non-appearance. He has now been asked to join the investigation and appear before the ED in Mumbai on February 26.The PNB, in its response to a mail written by Nirav Modi, said: “Your commitment and undertaking for sparing of the total liability was not backed by providing upfront amounts. However, should you have any implementable plan, do revert back.” PNB had told Nirav Modi that he was getting LoUs issued illegally and in an unauthorised way through a few bank officials.  “At no stage such facilities were extended by our bank to your three partner firms,” it said. PNB said when the illegal activities of Nirav Modi surfaced, the bank had brought them to the notice of the law enforcement agencies as they appeared to violate Fema and the anti-money laundering law.Last week, in a letter to PNB, Modi had said PNB’s over-zealousness had destroyed his jewellery brand and also jeopardised his ability to clear dues. On Thursday, PNB informed the stock exchanges that it had enough assets and capital to meet any liability that was decided as per the law. On Modi’s allegation that PNB closed all options to recover dues by going public, the bank replied: “We have followed the lawful avenues available to us as per the law of the land to recover our dues.” On why it had not informed stock exchanges about the filing of FIR with the CBI at the occurrence of the event, the PNB said: “Since law-enforcing agencies were assigned to investigate the matter, any news in public would have altered the fraudster, affecting recovery.”Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday seized mutual funds and shares worth `100 crores of the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi groups in connection with its money-laundering probe into the case.

The comments by MEA spokesman Raveesh Kumar come a day ahead of the expiry of the one-week time given to Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi to respond why their passports should not be revoked. On the location of Modi, Mr Kumar said: “The matter should be addressed to the law enforcement agencies. There are certain investigations and legal procedures which need to be completed before the ministry comes into the picture.”Asked about the notice to Modi, he said: “He has acknowledged in the sense there was some confusion on the address where it was to be sent. And the request had been received to send the notice to a particular email ID. Accordingly, the notice was sent to the email ID as requested.” Mr Kumar also noted that on the investigative agencies’ advice, the MEA had suspended the passports of both Modi and Choksi.', 'A new study now suggests that turmeric is more effective than popular painkillers at easing the agony of sports injuries.The study found that after less than three weeks, taking a key component of the Indian staple spice, known as curcumin, eases injured rugby players’ discomfort just as much paracetamol or ibuprofen, but without their side effects.Those opting for medication over the curry ingredient are four times more likely to suffer gastro-related complications, the research adds.According to study author Dr Francesco Di Pierro from the Milan-based pharmaceutical company Velleja Research, the study suggests that naturally-derived, curcumin-based product could represent a promising safe, analgesic remedy in painful osteo-muscular conditions associated with intense, high impact, physical activities.The researchers further believe that curcumin may also benefit sufferers of inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis patients, without causing the complications associated with many existing treatments.Curcumin has been used as a herbal remedy in arthritis, cancer and heart disease.Results further reveal those taking curcumin are more likely to stick to their treatment regimen.The researchers analysed 50 rugby players from the Italian premier Piacenza club south of Milan who were suffering bone or muscle problems as a result of incidents, such as repeated tackling.Half of the study’s participants were given the one gram curcumin-extract tablet Algocur, which is known as Turmeric+ in the UK, twice a day for up to 10 days. The remainder took painkillers.The findings were published in the European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences journal.This comes after research released last month suggested turmeric may boost people’s memories by nearly 30 per cent, as well as easing depression.Taking curcumin causes people to have significantly less protein build-up in the regions of the brain associated with memory and emotion, a study found.Past studies have also linked the onset of Alzheimer’s disease to the accumulation of protein plaques in the brain.Curcumin, which gives turmeric its yellow color, is thought to improve memory and boost mental health due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation has previously been linked to both dementia and severe depression.', 'Mumbai: Nearly seventy years after Independence, the Gharapuri Island that houses the world famous Elephanta Caves near Mumbai will now get an uninterrupted power supply.According to ANI, a 7.5-km long undersea cable has brought electricity to the world-famous Gharapuri Island, which houses the UNESCO world heritage site, just 10-km off from the Mumbai coast.Electricity connection made accessible to Elephanta Island after 70 years of Independence; a 7.5 km long undersea cable brought electricity to three villages- Raj Bander, Mora Bander & Shet Bander #Maharashtra pic.twitter.com/95SfooC7PD— ANI (@ANI) February 23, 2018“It’s a historic day today. This is the first time that such kind of big wire cable is used in the Arabian Sea to spread the lines for electricity,” Chandrashekhar Bawankule, Minister of Energy, New and Renewable Energy, said.The minister further said that the step would boost tourism and more people would now visit the world heritage site.The step will also benefit three villages including Raj Bander, Mora Bander and Shet Bander. The Elephanta Caves and three villages surrounding it have received power through generators in the past three decades.The shift to marine cables, according to officials, will eliminate concerns about intermittent supply and boost tourism on the island with a 950-strong population that sees huge footfalls. “MTDC (Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation) incurred major expenditure on diesel bills but provided electricity through generators for 27 years. The permanent supply will solve villagers’ problems,” Waghmare said.The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) began work on the project in 2015.“The 7.5-km cables are the longest laid on the seabed anywhere in India,” an MSEDCL official said.After several years, the Elephanta Festival was last month shifted back from the Gateway of India to Gharapuri.

Why did Jain change his stand within a day? Under whose pressure was he forced to change his statement?” Singh asked.Singh even claimed that Jain was picked up by the Delhi Police last morning and was pressured to change his statement.“How is it that the same Jain who emphatically said that he witnessed no assault during the entire time that he was present there, has now claimed otherwise?” the AAP leader said.Delhi Police, however, rejected the AAP charges.Special CP Dependra Pathak, the chief spokesperson of the Delhi Police, said, ”The department was only following rules and procedures.”“As per due process, a statement was recorded first by the police and then the statement was recorded before the court,” Pathak said.Singh had alleged that his party MLAs were being arrested for an “assault” for which there was no proof.On the other hand, despite there being video evidence of officials assaulting Delhi cabinet minister Imran Hussain, no action was taken by the Delhi Police, he added.The party also named a few Delhi government officials seen in the video purportedly showing the attack on Hussain and Khetan.Ashutosh said the medico-legal case report of Prakash states he was assaulted after 12 am but the CCTV camera footage shows he left Kejriwal’s residence at 11.30 pm. He said Delhi government officials going on strike following the alleged attack on Prakash was “unfortunate”.', 'JAIPUR: Farmers in Rajasthan staged a massive protest on the Jaipur-Sikar highway on Thursday to draw the attention of the authorities towards their demands.

Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria said the farmers were stopped on the outskirts in line with the orders issued by the high court, and that no serious cases had been registered against any of them.As per reports, the state government had arrested Kisan Mahasabha president Amara Ram, Pemaram and over 80 farmer leaders two days back to avert the protest.Independent MLA Kirodilal Meena and Hanuman Beliwal, who announced forming a third front a few months back, were also part of this protest.The farmer leaders announced that they would again stage demonstrations at the state assembly on February 22.', 'New Delhi: The future of 5,000 Aircel employees hangs in balance amidst reports that company may close its services soon, media reports have said.Quoting recruitment agencies a financial daily report has said that these head hunters have recieved several resumes from Aircel employees following a warning letter issued by the company recently.The market already choked by lay offs in the telecom sector may not be ready to accomodate fresh CVs being floated by the Aircel employees, some recruitment agencies believe.Aircel has reportedly warned its employees to be ready for “difficult” times ahead in the wake of funding crunch that may lead the company to file for bankruptcy,  as per a report in Economic Times.Amidst intense competition in the market, the Maxis-owned telco’s operations has not been able to keep pace with rivals.Aircel’s chief executive officer Kaizad Heerjee, in an email to employees earlier this week,  said that the company has “no funding for some time” and has been dependent on “cash generation from its “current business operations”.The paper earlier this week reported that Aircel will soon file for bankruptcy at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).The board of the telecom company, which has a Rs 15,500 crore debt, has been dissolved ahead of the move. The application to the NCLT will be submitted within a few days.The decision has been reportedly taken following the Reserve Bank of India scrapping all debt revamp schemes in favour of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Since Aircel has not made payments since September, banks cannot restructure Aircel.Two weeks ago Idea Cellular suspended interconnect services with Aircel for non- payment of dues. Idea said it will restore interconnect services immediately after Aircel makes the payment, but did not specify the outstanding amount.Idea said that despite multiple reminders since November 2017, the operator had failed to meet its payment commitments forcing Idea to suspend interconnect services, as per the terms of interconnect agreement.Aircel and Reliance Communications had signed binding agreements in September 2016 for the merger of RCom’s mobile businesses with Aircel.

With rain lashing the SuperSport Park, Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal found it difficult to grip the ball and bled 64 in four overs as South Africa chased down the target comfortably to level the three-match series 1-1.“Tough one for the bowlers. We were looking at 175 with the loss of early wickets. Manish and Raina batted well initially. Manish and MS were outstanding to get to 190. I thought that was a winning total. Then the weather made it hard for the bowlers. Till the 12th over it was fine but with the drizzle, the wicket settled down. The ball was difficult to grip too,” Kohli said.Asked about the conditions, Kohli said: “You don’t want play to be stopped. Once the game was continued in the first innings, we knew it was going to be continued throughout. We didn’t really have problems with the conditions, it was a constant drizzle, was fine to play.”Kohli praised South African batsmen for constructing their chase well. “Credit to the SA batsmen. Klaasen and Duminy really batted well. They were very positive. Good from the spectator point of view,” he said. “They took calculated risks. They targeted the short boundary and it came off for them. They deserve to win. We expect them to show some fight. They showed the passion which is needed to win games of cricket. They deserved to win tonight.”Satisfied with his team’s effort, South Africa captain JP Duminy termed it as an “easy” win. “At the toss, we spoke about this being a semifinal. The way we started with the ball was exceptional. They gained momentum with the last five overs but our batsmen showed composure. Pretty easy win in the end,” he said.Duminy said they constructed the chase keeping DLS system in mind. “We tried our utmost to keep with the DLS system. In the end, it worked in our favour because it gave us the freedom. It was raining a bit in our bowling innings as well. We knew we had to set the tone with a good first over,” he said.“They came at us a bit but it was key to pick wickets in the powerplay. To take down 189 was a pretty good effort. Certainly will be a good crowd for Cape Town. Hopefully, we can put up a good spectacle.”', 'Bajaj has officially launched the Avenger 180 at Rs 83,475 (ex-showroom, Maharashtra).

The 180 sticks to the blacked-out theme and features alloy wheels, a smaller cowl that sits neatly atop its new headlight, a matte-black exhaust with an aluminium-finish heat shield and tip, as well as a new grab rail. It also features the revised seat from the 220, aimed at improving long-distance riding comfort.The Avenger 180 uses an 180cc motor that makes 15.5hp at 8,500rpm and 13.7Nm of torque at 6,500rpm. Like the 220, this bike uses a five-speed gearbox. For now, Bajaj has refused to divulge details on the origins of this motor (i.e if it’s the same as on the Pulsar 180 with a detune or a new generation of engines) – we should find out at the time of our first ride experience. The Avenger 180 also gets the same 260mm front disc and 130mm rear drum brake and like the 220 it also misses out on ABS. The bike also uses the same telescopic fork and twin rear shock absorbers as well. The Avenger 180 has a wheelbase of 1480mm, a 13-litre fuel tank and a kerb weight of 150kg. It is available in two colours – Ebony Black and Spicy Red.In terms of competition, the Bajaj Avenger 180 impressively undercuts the 150cc Suzuki Intruder by around Rs 15,000. The Intruder makes 14.8hp and 14Nm of torque while also being paired to a five-speed gearbox. At 1405mm, the Intruder also has a shorter wheelbase and a smaller 11-litre fuel tank. However, the Intruder does get ABS as standard and a front and rear disc brake.', 'Lucknow: In a heart-wrenching incident, an 18-year-old woman was allegedly burnt to death on Thursday night in Bara Sagwar area of Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district by unidentified miscreants.The incident took place when she was returning from the market on her bicycle. According to her family, the victim had left her house around 7 pm.A witness to the incident saw the woman in flames near Bara Sagwar between her house and the market at around 8 pm, a report in Hindustan Times said.The witness also told the police that he couldn’t do much to save the woman. The charred body of the woman was found at the spot. A plastic container, partially filled with petrol, and matchbox were found close to the body. Her bicycle and the vegetables were lying nearby.The victim’s mother and brother have alleged that she was burnt alive by unidentified people.The body has been sent for postmortem. The police are investigating the matter.Lucknow IG Sujit Pandey and Unnao SP Pushpanjali Devi also reached the spot and took the stock of the situation.“We will nab the culprit as soon as possible after collecting all the evidences,” the police said.Lucknow ADG, Rajeev Krishna said police were treating the case as homicide since it appears that the girl had been murdered.', 'A greedy son hired a hitman to kill his wealthy parents.The 22-year-old from Sochi, Russia planned the plot to murder his parents and 10-year-old sister down to a tee. He drew up a floor plan for the hitman he hired that detailed where the cameras in the home are, how to stay away from the guard dogs.  What he didn’t know was the hitman he hired for a fee was actually an undercover police officer, the Metro reported.To catch him, detective had his parents participate in a mock-up using fake blood coming out of fake knife wounds. Then the hitman arranged to meet with the boy in Mecedes to show proof the job had been done.On seeing the photos of his “dead” parents, the boy is said to have expressed “delight”. When he agreed to pay the “assassin” £38,000, he was arrested by armed police.At a police station in Krasnodar region, the man confessed to his crimes and admitted he did this to obtain their money. Police also learned this was not his first attempt and he had been plotting to kill them for months. He faces up to 15 years in jail if he is convicted.His devastated parents are still under shock and can’t imagine that he could be capable of doing such a thing. The Metro reported his father runs a major education institution in Sochi.', 'Cape Town: India would be eyeing a perfect end to what has been a thoroughly roller-coaster tour when they take on a depleted but not completely deflated South Africa in the decisive third Twenty20 International here on Saturday. Having suffered a minor setback in the previous game, India will look to recover and close out this eight-week long tour with a series win. The three-match series is level at 1-1 after the Men in Blue won the first T20I in Johannesburg by 28 runs. The Proteas bounced back in Centurion with a six-wicket win. India have never played T20 cricket at Newlands.This will be their first such outing, while South Africa have a less than impressive record here. They have played 8 T20Is, and lost 5 of them here.The two wins came in the 2007 World T20 and as such the hosts have only ever won a singular bilateral T20I game (against England in 2016) at Cape Town. It doesn’t necessarily give the visitors an advantage.Through this limited-overs leg, South Africa have shown that they are more comfortable in the T20 setting, having won the rain-truncated Pink ODI as well as coming close while chasing 204 in the first match of this series, both at Wanderers. Victory in the previous game will also be a reason for buoyancy in the Proteas dressing room. Stand-in skipper JP Duminy was adamant that they had well-set plans for Indian batsmen and bowlers since the start of this series but just needed proper execution as was showcased at SuperSport Park.It was seen in how the hosts made pointed changes in their bowling plans, and then took the attack to India’s bowlers.Duminy had named an unchanged eleven in the previous game, and it remains to be seen if they will bother breaking away from this consistency in the series-decider. Jon-Jon Smuts has not come good yet despite his big-hitting prowess, while David Millers poor form has spilled over from the ODIs.He was persisted with throughout that series, so there is no reason to doubt that the Proteas team management will back him to come good at a crucial juncture. Jasprit Bumrah’s abdominal strain had forced India to make a change, but they will consider a couple spots for this finale.Bumrah’s fitness still remains a question mark. Will the team management risk playing him given the shortened time-frame of this match? The fact that there is a two-week gap before the tri-series begins in Sri Lanka might coerce them into this gamble.The bowling combination is the other concern. India have shown a propensity to field a left-arm pacer in this format, but Jaydev Unadkat has proven expensive so far. He has picked up two wickets for 75 runs at an economy of 9.78.Yuzvendra Chahal has also been hammered (one wicket for 103 runs in 8 overs at economy 12.87) and Heinrich Klaasen eager to face him once again. Given the scenario, Virat Kohli might just be inspired to change the look and shape of his bowling attack.If Bumrah does play, Unadkat is likely to make way for him. Shardul Thakuar used clever change of pace at Centurion and picked 1/31 in his four-over spell.The Newlands pitch had played slow during the ODI series, and citing the example of Supersport Park, there is every reason to expect another wicket on the slower side, if not dual-paced altogether.Arguably, Chahal bowls a more consistent line than Kuldeep Yadav and this explains latters omission from the first two games. However, with Chahals confidence hitting a bit low, Yadav could find himself in reckoning for this all-important game.Further, given South Africa’s frailty against change of pace, India might even be tempted to consider Axar Patel, thus increasing the onus on Hardik Pandya as the third-choice pacer.India’s tour had gained momentum with victory in the Wanderers Test and then they carried it through the ODI series, romping home with a 5-1 margin.The team management usually clubs all formats together and is celebrating ascendancy over South Africa since the last week of January.As such, they will be keen to fly out with an additional trophy to show for this run of form.Teams (from): India: Virat Kohli (capt), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, MS Dhoni (wk), Hardik Pandya, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Jaydev Unadkat, Shardul Thakur. South Africa: JP Duminy (capt), Farhaan Behardien, Junior Dala, Reeza Hendricks, Christiaan Jonker, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), David Miller, Chris Morris, Dane Paterson, Aaron Phangiso, Andile Phehlukwayo, Tabraiz Shamsi, Jon-Jon Smuts. Match starts at: 9.30 pm IST.', 'Mumbai: India Under-19 scripted history recently, when they lifted the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand for the fourth time. Shubman Gill was the star for the colts in the tournament, as he was adjudged as man of the series for his solid performance with the bat. Anukul Roy was the top wicket taker, but Rajasthan pacer Kamlesh Nagarkoti grabbed eyeballs  with his express pace during the event.The right arm pacer was instrumental in India’s success as the boys in blue remained unbeaten throughout the tournament as they outplayed their opponents from the first match till the end. Nagarkoti, who played under Prithvi Shaw and coached by the legendary Rahul Dravid, alongside fellow paceman Shivan Mavi  proved handy for other teams throughout the tournament.Nagarkoti with his express pace consistently troubled batsmen as he clocked more than 140 kmph. Speaking to Mumbai Mirror, the 18-year-old pacer, gave an insight on how coach Dravid did not let them indulge their adventurous side.He along with fellow pacer Shivam Mavi and opening batsman Manjot  Kalra were giving an interview atop a mountain in Queenstown and were tempted to indulge in “adventure activities there”, but the coach did not allow that.\\n“He said the tournament was going on, and there was no point in taking any risk,” said Nagarkoti. “He would allow us to do a few things here and there, but we had to be back in our hotel by a certain time.”When asked if he ever thought about breaking the curfew set by coach, he replied  “Actually we were a bit scared of sir. And we thought we should not break the curfew, so we never did it. Honestly, we didn’t. Well, we did think about it a few times but then we reasoned that ‘nahi yaar, sir would have had something in mind when putting a curfew in place, so let’s follow it’, adding that he hopes to take a late night stroll in Australia sometime in the future.”The player also revealed that his first autograph was of Rahul Dravid when the team was together for the Asia Cup.Nagarkoti was recently signed by Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2018 players auction. The youngster along with other teammates is excited to be part of the cash-rich league, where these youngsters will rub shoulders with some of the big names in world cricket.“Manjot (Delhi Daredevils) was telling me ki bachke rehna, maarunga mere saamne aayega toh (Beware I will hit you when you come on to bowl at me). All of us have played against each other a lot and know each other’s games,” he said.', 'Centurion: Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had lost his cool on Wednesday during the second Twenty20 against South Africa. It was during the 20th over when MS Dhoni was shouting at Manish Pandey.Earlier, it was reported that the Jharkhand batsman had used swear words in Hindi which went like , ““Oye. Bh****ke. Idhar dekh le. Udhar kya dekh raha hai. (Look here. Why are you staring over there). However, all confusions on that has been cleared and what he meant was a simple message to the 28-year-old Pandey.“Oyee.. Bhootni ke, Idhar dekh le, bole they na idhar dekhne, udhar kya dekh raha hai.. Main Idhar khada hu na Batting Kar Raha.”(Hey, where are you looking? Look here, why are you looking there… I am standing at batting end).”That was what the 36-year-old big-hitter had told.Earlier, the video of Dhoni shouting to Pandey had gone viral, and was doing the rounds on the internet.After losing to Proteas in the second T20, Virat Kohli’s men will look to sign off the South African tour by bagging another series, as the two teams head to Cape Town for the third match.', 'Fort Lauderdale: The armed officer on duty at the Florida school in US where a shooter killed 17 people never went inside to engage the gunman and has been placed under investigation, officials announced Thursday.The Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a gunman armed with an AR-15 style assault rifle has reignited a national debate in the US over gun laws and school safety, including proposals by US president Donald Trump and others to designate more people — including trained teachers — to carry arms on school grounds. Gun-control advocates, meanwhile, have redoubled their push to ban assault rifles. The school resource officer at the high school took up a position viewing the western entrance of the building that was under attack for more than four minutes, but “he never went in,” Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at a Thursday news conference. The shooting lasted about six minutes.The officer, Scot Peterson, was suspended without pay and placed under investigation, then chose to resign, Israel said. When asked what Peterson should have done, Israel said the deputy should have “went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer.”The sheriff said he was “devastated, sick to my stomach. There are no words. I mean, these families lost their children. …. I’ve been to the funerals. … I’ve been to the vigils. It’s just, ah, there are no words.”There was also a communication issue between the person reviewing the school’s security system footage and officers who responded to the school.Coral Springs Police Chief Tony Pustizzi said during a Thursday news conference that the footage being reviewed was 20 minutes old, so the responding officers were hearing that the shooter was in a certain place while officers already in that location were saying that wasn’t the case.“There was nothing wrong with their equipment. Their equipment works,” Pustizzi said. “It’s just that when the person was reviewing the tape from 20 minutes earlier, somehow that wasn’t communicated to the officers that it was a 20-minute delay.”Pustizzi said the confusion didn’t put anyone in danger.Nikolas Cruz had history of violenceGunman Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been jailed on 17 counts of murder and has admitted the attack. He owned a collection of weapons. Defense attorneys, state records and people who knew him indicate that he displayed behavioural troubles for years.Broward County incident reports show that unidentified callers contacted authorities with concerns about Cruz in February 2016 and November 2017. The first caller said they had third-hand information that Cruz planned to shoot up the school. The information was forwarded to the Stoneman Douglas resource officer. The second caller said Cruz was collecting guns and knives and believed “he could be a school shooter in the making.”Also in November 2017, Cruz was involved in a fight with the adult son of a woman he was staying with shortly after his mother died, according to a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office report. On 28 November, a 22-year-old man at the Lake Worth home told the responding deputy that he tried to calm down Cruz, who had been punching holes in walls and breaking objects, but Cruz hit him in the jaw, and the man hit Cruz back.The deputy found Cruz a short time later at a nearby park. Cruz told the deputy he had been angry because he misplaced a photo of his recently deceased mother, and he apologized for losing his temper.The other man told the deputy he didn’t want Cruz arrested. He just wanted Cruz to calm down before coming home.Politicians under pressure to tighten gun laws in response to the mass shooting floated various plans Thursday, but most fell short of reforms demanded by student activists who converged Wednesday on Florida’s Capitol.Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran said Thursday night that his chamber is going to recommend creating a special commission to investigate the “abject breakdown at all levels” that led to the shooting deaths.The Republican said the commission, likely be led by a parent of one of the slain children, would have subpoena power.Corcoran also said the news about the resource officer’s failure to respond did not dissuade him from moving ahead with what he was calling the “marshal” plan to let local law-enforcement officials train and deputise someone at the school who would be authorised to carry a gun.“He’s not indicative of the law enforcement community; that’s not going to change our behaviour at all,” Corcoran said.US and gun controlState Senator Bill Galvano, who is helping craft a bill in response to the shooting deaths, insisted the idea is not the same as arming teachers. He said the programme would be optional and the deputised person would have to be trained by local law-enforcement agencies.US Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said a visit to Stoneman Douglas prompted him to change his stance on large-capacity magazines. The Republican insisted he is willing to rethink his past opposition to gun proposals if there is information the policies would prevent mass shootings.“If we are going to infringe on the Second Amendment, it has to be a policy that will work,” Rubio said in an interview Thursday with AP.A day after an emotional meeting with survivors and their families, Trump tweeted his strongest stance yet on gun control. He said he would endorse strengthening background checks, banning “bump stock” style devices and raising the minimum age to 21 for buying certain rifles.At a conference of conservative activists Thursday near Washington, Vice President Mike Pence said the administration would make school safety “our top national priority” after the shooting at the school in Parkland, Florida.Calling school shootings “evil in our time,” Pence exhorted those in positions of authority “to find a way to come together with American solutions.”It was a markedly different tone than that deployed on stage minutes earlier by NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre, who delivered an unbowed defense of gun ownership and lashed out at Democrats — saying they are using the tragedy for “political gain.”', 'Islamabad: Pakistan’s deposed premier Nawaz Sharif Thursday alleged that efforts were being made to “oust” him from politics for life, a day after he was disqualified by the Supreme Court from leading his party.Sharif spoke to reporters after appearing before the accountability court in Islamabad where he is being tried for alleged corruption in the Panama Papers case. “This decision (disqualification from leading a party) is not unexpected for me. First, they paralysed the executive and yesterday they snatched the powers of parliament,” he said.He did not specify who he meant by “they” but apparently it was a reference to the judges of the top court.Sharif, 68, was disqualified as prime minister by Pakistan’s top court in July last year under Article 62 for failing to declare a receivable salary as an asset.He said Wednesday’s decision was a continuation of the top court verdict of July 28 when he was sacked as prime minister, and added that deliberations were being made to oust him from politics for life.“In the decision of July 28 my premiership was snatched. In the decision of yesterday the post of president of Pakistan Muslim League (N) was snatched…My name is Muhammad Nawaz Sharif. If you want to snatch this name from me, go ahead and take it away,” he said.He criticised the decision of the court which said the Election Act 2017 was “person-specific” to facilitate Sharif to lead his party, adding that “decisions of the Supreme Court are Nawaz Sharif-specific”.“These decisions are being given in anger and smack of vengeance,” he said.Sharif appeared in court accompanied by daughter Maryam and son-in-law Mohammad Safdar, who are co-accused in one of the three cases.It was his 18th appearance in the court.The court reserved judgment on objections by Sharif about supplementary references by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and postponed the hearing until this afternoon.It also decided to record statements of two UK-based witnesses via video link.Later, Sharif consulted his party leaders during a high-level meeting about the implications of the decision and appointing a new president of the PML-N.Sources said Sharif’s ailing wife Kulsoom Nawaz and his younger brother Shahbaz were favourites to get the coveted post of PML-N president.Some party leaders favour Yaqoob Nasir or Raja Zafarul Haq as interim president before settling on a permanent choice, according to sources.Earlier, when Sharif stepped down as prime minister and PML-N chief after his disqualification by the Supreme Court, Nasir had been appointed as interim president of the party.Sharif later on took over leadership of party after Election Law 2017 removed the disqualification bar to become head of a political party.Sharif was given a warm welcome when he arrived at the Punjab House to participate in the meeting.Meanwhile, PML-N leaders rejected the decision by the court and promised that the party would bounce back to win the election this year.Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the PML-N had faced a “worse time than the existing one and will overcome all difficulties”.Minister of State for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb said the future of the party will be decided in consultation with the senior leadership but that Sharif would take final decisions about who will lead the party.The decision of court was welcomed by Sharif’s arch rival Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Khan who today claimed that Sharif had secretly met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“What sort of leader Sharif is, as he met Modi in secret because he wanted to keep it secret from the army,” Khan said without sharing any details of the alleged meeting.Sharif and some of his family members are facing charges relating to their ownership of posh properties in London.Three cases were registered by the National Accountability Bureau against Sharif, his children and son-in-law in the court on September 8.', 'Brussels: Police closed down a street in southern Brussels in a major security operation involving specialist armed units on Thursday after a report of a possible murder.A police spokeswoman denied media reports that an armed gunman was hiding in the area. She said that the special units of the federal police had been deployed after a Polish man reported that someone had been murdered in the morning. “They are searching the buildings but we can say there has not been any terrorist attack,” she said.Brussels is still on alert after suicide bombers killed 32 people at the airport and on the metro in March 2016.', 'Lima: At least 44 people died in Peru on Wednesday when a bus hurtled some 100 meters into a ravine in the mountainous south in the country’s second major bus crash in 2018, a local official said.“According to a report from the Peruvian National Police, there are 44 confirmed deaths as of now,” Yamila Osorio, the governor of the Arequipa region, wrote on Twitter. The bus was carrying some 45 passengers, according to operator Rey Latino, but police said the figure was likely higher because additional passengers boarded along the route and did not appear in the initial register.The crash occurred on a curve on the Panamericana Sur highway in the Ocona district. Road accidents are common in Peru, where roads are considered unsafe and bus drivers lack training.“My condolences to the relatives of the victims of the transit accident in Arequipa,” President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski wrote on Twitter. “We have taken all steps to provide immediate rescue support and transfer victims to the closest health centres so they can be attended immediately.”At least 48 people died in early January when a bus collided with a truck and careened off a cliff near the area of Pasamayo on the Pacific coast.', 'Meerut: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that only India can show the right path to the world and Hindus need to unite.Addressing the ‘Rashtroday Sammelan’ in western Uttar Pradesh, Bhagwat had said on Sunday that everyone will have to unite for the country. He had added that there had been and there will be conspiracies against India’s unity, but everyone will have to remain united.Union ministers from western Uttar Pradesh Mahesh Sharma, Gen VK Singh, Satyapal Singh, and state ministers Chetan Chauhan and Dharam Singh Saini were present at the programme.“All Hindus are one, say with pride we’re one. Hindus must unite, this is our duty,” Bhagwat had said and had stressed that if the country remains united, “we can cut through a lot of barriers.”“If we don’t remain united, the whole world can take advantage of that,” he had said. Praising RSS workers, he had pointed out that more than 1,70,000 volunteers are doing social service and they are willing to lay down their lives in the service of the nation. Earlier, on February 11, 2018, a controversy had erupted the RSS chief had reportedly said Bihar, “Sangh will prepare military personnel within three days which the Army would do in 6-7 months. This is our capability,” as per PTI. However, the RSS had clarified that he had not compared the Army with Sangh volunteers and his remarks on the matter were “misrepresented.”“Bhagwat’s remarks were made as a comparison between common people and sangh swayamsevak (volunteers) and were in “no way a comparison” with the Indian Army, RSS Akhil Bhartiya Prachaar Pramukh Manmohan Vaidya had said in a statement, seeking to douse the controversy. “Bhagwat ji had said that if the situation arises and the Constitution permits, Indian Army would take six months to prepare the society whereas sangh swayamsevak can be trained in three days as swayamsevak practice discipline regularly. This was no way a comparison between the Indian army and the Sangh swayamsevaks but it was a comparison between general society and swayamsevaks. Both are to be trained by the Indian Army only,” the statement had said.', 'New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered Rs 97 crore loan default case against Simbhaoli Sugars Ltd, its CMD Gurmit Singh Mann, Deputy MD Gurupal Singh and others.The premiere agency is also carrying out searches at multiple locations in Delhi and UP in connection with case against Simbhaoli Sugars Ltd, officials have said.The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered the case on a complaint from Oriental Bank of Commerce against a private Sugar Company based at Simbhaoli, Hapur, Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh); it’s CMD and others including Directors, CEO, CFO and unknown bank officials and other private persons, for causing the loss to the Bank.The case comes at a time when the banking sector already facing a rough time amidst biggest banking fraud totalling over Rs 11,400 crore as state-run lender PNB has alleged that two of its employees colluded with firms linked to well-known jewellers Nirav Modi and his uncle, Mehul Choksi.', \"New Delhi: Even as the controversy over assault to Delhi chief secretary refuses to die down, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Naresh Balyan said on Friday that people like Anshu Prakash deserve to be beaten up.While addressing a rally in Uttam Nagar, Balyan said, “What happened with the chief secretary, he levelled false allegations on us, but I say officers like these should be beaten up, those who stop the work of the common man should be meted out this treatment.”#WATCH: While addressing a rally in Uttam Nagar, AAP MLA Naresh Balyan says, 'jo Chief Secy ke sath hua, jo inhone jhootha aarop lagaya, main to keh raha hu aise adhikariyo ko thokna chahye, jo aam aadmi ke kaam rok ke baithe hain aise adhikariyo ke sath yahi salook hona chahye.' pic.twitter.com/BDamX7TJGe— ANI (@ANI) February 23, 2018Meanwhile, a Delhi court on Thursday dismissed the bail pleas of two AAP MLAs, Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal, arrested for allegedly assaulting Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash.Metropolitan Magistrate Shefali Barnala Tondon, however, refused to grant the police their custody saying there was no new ground for custodial interrogation.The court had on Thursday sent the MLAs to 14-day judicial custody.The two MLAs were arrested in connection with the alleged assault on Delhi’s top bureaucrat during a meeting at Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence.

Informatised warfare, a term widely used by the Chinese military in recent years refers to the use of IT, digital and artificial intelligence applications in battlefield conditions.The Sky Wolf Commandos, a branch of the PLA Special Operations Forces from the Western Theatre Command, have been equipped with the QTS-11 system in their training, Weihutang, a column affiliated with the China Central Television (CCTV), reported. The Western Theatre Command looks after the security along the 3,488 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India.The QTS-11 system, according to Chinese experts, is similar to the one being used by US soldiers. Hailed as the “strongest individual firepower in the world”, the QTS-11 system not only contains firearms but also a full digitalised integrated individual soldier combat system, including detection and communications, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert told state-run Global Times.   The system, which includes an assault rifle and 20-millimeter grenade launcher, is capable of destroying antipersonnel targets. Each soldier equipped with the system is armed with a thermal imager and optoelectronic and positioning systems, the Global Times quoted a report by Science and Technology Daily. QTS-11 system weighs up to seven kgs.  “The individual soldier combat system is only part of the digitalised army, something countries are attempting to do. Developing the integrated individual soldier combat system adapts to informatized warfare in the future,” Song said.   “QTS-11 systems of the US and China are similar but not comparable. The system’s capability depends on how it is used,” Song said.      Special operations forces are the first to have a taste of the QTS-11 system before the system would be widely equipped into other forces. The system is also very expensive, Song said.   The announcement by the official media of the deployment of new system along the border with India followed a report a few days ago of the upgrading the air defences along the LAC was seen by military observers here as a psychological warfare being resorted to by the PLA.The Global Times earlier quoted an expert as saying the upgradation of the air defence with deployment of fighter jets like J-10 and J-11 is aimed at “confronting any threat from India” in the light of India acquiring new fighter aircraft, an apparent reference to Rafale aircraft.     The Chinese military carried out a media blitzkrieg during the height of last year’s 73-day Dokalam standoff highlighting deployment of new battle tank as well as massive military exercises on the Tibetan plateau.   The standoff over PLA’s attempts to build a road close to the strategic narrow Chicken Neck corridor in North East ended after the Chinese military stopped the road building in the area which is also claimed by Bhutan.   The integrated combat system was firstly developed by the US but they have dropped the research of Objective Individual Combat Weaponry system due to weight problems. ', 'BALASORE: The Indian military successfully test-fired the Dhanush missile from a warship off the coast of Odisha on Friday morning. The Dhanush missile is also known as the Prithvi-III, and is a short-range ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.Dhanush is the naval variant of the surface-to-surface Prithvi missile platform. It can be used for both ship-to-ship and ship-to-surface strikes. The missile has a declared strike range of 350 km, and is capable of carrying a warhead up to 500 kg in weight. The missile may also be fitted with conventional warheads.Officials told news agency PTI that Friday’s test of the Dhanush was a “complete success” and that all the mission objectives had been achieved. All flight parameters were monitored and verified by the telemetry and radar facilities of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which developed the Dhanush missile.The missile test was carried out by the Strategic Forces Command, the tri-services military command that controls all of India’s nuclear weapons and their associated delivery systems.The Dhanush missile made its first test flight in 2000, with the first fully operational test conducted in 2004. It has been test-fired a total of seven times so far. The last time the Dhanush was test fired was in November 2015.The design of the Dhanush missile features customisations to the Prithvi platform to make it suitable for launch from a ship. These design modifications would include a stabilisation platform.The Dhanush/Prithvi-III is part of the five missile platforms that have been developed by the DRDO since 1983, as part of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). The other families of missiles developed under the IGMPD are Agni, Trishul, Akash and Nag.(With inputs from PTI)', 'New Delhi: Breaking his silence over the Rs 11,400-crore fraud at India’s second-biggest public sector lender Punjab National Bank (PNB), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that his government will take stringent action against financial irregularities and not tolerate loot of public money.Days after the fraud allegedly masterminded by diamantaire Nirav Modi came to light, the Prime Minister asked the management of financial institutions as well as the supervisory bodies to do their job diligently to check such frauds.“I want to make it clear that this government has been taking strict action against financial irregularities and will continue to take strict action,” he said at an event in the national capital. “System will not tolerate loot of public money,” PM Modi said.Nirav Modi, whose diamond creations have draped Hollywood stars such as Kate Winslet and Dakota Johnson, and firms linked to him are alleged to have acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) from one PNB branch in Mumbai between 2011 and 2017 to obtain loans from Indian banks overseas. Central investigative agencies have raided Modi’s properties and arrested bank employees.Without naming either the alleged kingpin of the fraud, billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, or Punjab National Bank, the Prime Minister said the management of financial institutions, auditors and regulators should perform their duty with full dedication.“I want to make an appeal to those who have been entrusted with the job of framing rules and policies and maintaining ethics to do their job diligently and with dedication,” he said, adding this should especially be followed by those who have been entrusted with the responsibility of supervision and monitoring.Noting that the Union government is going to complete four years of assuming office in a few months, he said that a definite change is now visible. “This change in the economic and social content, represents the essence of the New Rules for the New India and the New Economy,” the Prime Minister said.He said that in the last four years, the discourse has changed from India being a `fragile five` economy to the target of India becoming a `five trillion dollar` economy.Presenting figures to indicate how India is playing a key role in the entire world`s growth, he said that in nominal terms, India`s share of the world GDP has risen from 2.4 percent in 2013 to 3.1 percent in 2017.“India is performing better on various macro-economic parameters,” he said.Modi said that this change has come about due to a new approach and a new work culture. “India`s competitiveness is being validated by the entire world today.”Recalling that when he had last attended this event, GST was still just a possibility, he said: “Today it is a reality, which has delivered a better tax compliance system and a better revenue system.” He also mentioned other major reforms such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Giving examples of the increase in pace in the various projects in the infrastructure sector, he said that speed, scale and sensitivity are important to ensure the success of the government`s initiatives. “There is unprecedented investment being made today in infrastructure, agriculture, technology, health sector and education sector,” he said mentioning the initiatives taken in the health sector, such as Mission Indradhanush, Jan Aushadhi Stores, and the Ayushman Bharat scheme.About the Digital India Mission, Modi said that the trinity of 100 crore bank accounts, 100 crore Aadhaar cards and 100 crore mobile phones, would create a unique ecosystem, not seen anywhere else in the world.Recalling that in his last address at the event, he had spoken of Housing for All, Power for All, Clean Cooking for All, Health for All, and Insurance for All, he now outlined the steps that have been taken in regard to house construction, Ssaubhagya yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, and insurance. Saying that the government’s initiatives are aimed at empowering the poor, the Prime Minister also mentioned the construction of toilets, distribution of loans through the Mudra Yojana and distribution of soil health cards.', 'New Delhi: Voting for 58 Rajya Sabha seats from 16 states will be held on March 23, 2018. The last date of filing nominations is March 12.58 members of the Upper House slated to complete their term in April 2018.The retiring members include 10 from Uttar Pradesh, six each from Bihar and Maharashtra, five each Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, four members from Gujarat and Karnataka while the number is three each for Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Rajasthan. Two members will retire from Jharkhand while Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have one retiring member each. Besides the biennial elections, the EC has also announced bypoll to a Rajya Sabha seat from Kerala after MP Veerendra Kumar resigned in December. His term was to end in April, 2022.Some of the members, whose terms are ending, include union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Dharmendra Pradhan, JP Nadda, Thaawarchand Gehlot and Ramdas Athawale.In August 2017, the BJP had overtaken Congress to become the largest political party in the Rajya Sabha with 58 members against 57 of the Congress.This happened when BJP MP Sampatiya Uikey, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha following a bypoll in Madhya Pradesh took the oath. His election was necessitated by the death of union minister Anil Madhav Dave.This was the first time that the BJP had become the number one formation in the Rajya Sabha after the Narendra Modi government came to power in May 2014.', 'Mumbai: Nirav Modi has been charged with Rs. 11,400 crore fraud where he allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking from a state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) branch in Mumbai to secure overseas credit from other Indian lenders.Due to the scam, which became one of the most highlighted a few days back, the brand ambassadors Sidharth and Priyanka also came into limelight. The actress has now terminated her contract and quit as the brand ambassador of Nirav Modi jewels.Her spokesperson said, “In light of recent allegations, Priyanka Chopra has chosen to terminate her contract with the Nirav Modi brand.”The spokesperson had earlier mentioned in a statement, “There are speculative reports that Priyanka Chopra has sued Nirav Modi. This is not true. However, she is currently seeking legal opinion with respect to terminating her contract with the brand in light of allegations of financial fraud against Nirav Modi.”Sidharth Malhotra and Priyanka Chopra’s chemistry in the advertisement for Nirav Modi’s jewellery was surely contemplating, but only if they knew what a tragic turn fate will take for them.When asked, both of them kept mum on the fraud case, and Sidharth’s contract with them was luckily over, but PeeCee was stuck in the rat-hole, till she ended her contract now (most probably with legal consultation).Enforcement Directorate, after conducting multiple searches in connection with Rs. 280 crore money-laundering case, found the designer and others involved in the scam.', 'Mumbai: Rani Mukerji, who is occasionally seen in a public outing, has been promoting her forthcoming Yash Raj film ‘Hichki’ to a great extent.

She will put forward her views on the weaknesses that exist in society and how we could overcome them. Sri Sri will also put forward his views on the importance teachers have in imparting the right education for students so that they can identify weaknesses and tide over them,” a source close to the event had revealed.When contacted, Rani had also confirmed the information saying, “Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has focused on the power of positive thinking, of positive actions and of universal love and his message has resonated with countless people. It will be amazing to be part of this session and hear him speak. ‘Hichki’ is all about harnessing your positivity and inner peace to bring out the best in you and I’m going to speak about this in his presence.

Starring Zaira Wasim and Khan in an extended cameo, the film amassed a lot of wealth on the other side of the Great Wall and the numbers are still pouring in.Reason enough for Khan and team to celebrate. “We are really happy that Secret Superstar has done well and that audiences in many countries have appreciated it. The credit for all this should go to Advait (Chandan) who has done a great job of writing and directing the film. We are all very thrilled. The cast and crew of the film meets today after a very long time to celebrate people’s love for the film,” says an elated Aamir. Advait, on the other hand, gives all credit to Aamir. “I would like to borrow a line from Dangal: ‘Iska saara credit main apne tauji ko dena chahta hoon’,” he chuckles.Like his earlier films Dangal and PK, the collections of Aamir’s Secret Superstar stand at a record breaking `800 crore in the middle of the fifth week and are still going strong. “China’s emotional tone is very much like ours. Hence, our stories touch them. I am sure that there are a lot of Chinese films which we are unable to see, but are similar in nature. Things like emotions, family values and culture appeal to them,” explains Khan. Wife Kiran Rao is equally overjoyed. “We are so proud of the film. We made it with a lot of love and people enjoyed it. But we really did not expect it to be so well received in China. People were getting so emotionally attached to the film and laughing and crying with it. We are touched,” she says.Aamir is also thankful to the media for great reviews. “I want to thank the media because you have all supported us,” says Khan, who sported a hairband to hold his hair back. Ask if it is for his look in his forthcoming film Thugs of Hindostan, and the actor replies, “This is not my look in the film. I have much longer hair along with earrings etc, but you will see the real look only when you see the poster of the film.”Aamir adds that he will soon wrap up the film’s shoot. “We will have a schedule in Rajasthan, which will be the climax of the film. We will wrap up by the end of March,” says the actor.Secret Superstar has bagged a lot of awards as well, although award-recluse Aamir professes, “I do not know much about awards. Have we won any?” Pat comes the reply from director Advait, “Awards lete lete main thak gaya hoon!”\\nWell, that certainly calls for another super celebration!', 'Mumbai: Amitabh Bachchan is a megastar who has a tight packed schedule. He is working in ‘Thugs Of Hindostan’, ‘Brahmastra’ as well as ‘102 Not Out’.On Saturday, he shared a post of him recording a song, rather a rap in the recording studio, and later at mid-night he tweeted of his uneasiness. Sunday morning too had started on a sad note since Sridevi’s untimely demise was announced. Here’s a video of him recording:A source informed media, “Amitabh Bachchan stopped the shoot of ‘102 Not Out’ as Sridevi passed away.”When contact about the same Director Umesh Shukla confirmed, “Yes as a mark of respect to the sudden and untimely demise of our legendary actress Sridevi, we decided to cancel our today’s shoot of ‘102 Not Out’. May God give peace to her soul and strength to her family.”Sridevi was in Dubai when she was target to cardiac arrest. The actress was taken to the hospital but it was too late for anything.', 'Beijing: China’s ruling Communist Party on Sunday set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely, with a proposal to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to just two terms in office.Xi, 64, is currently required by the country’s constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. Nearing the end of his first term, he will be formally elected to a second at the annual meeting of China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament opening on March 5. There is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief, though a maximum 10-year term is the norm. He began his second term as head of the party and military in October at the end of a once-every-five-years party congress.The announcement, carried by state news agency Xinhua, gave few details. It said the proposal had been made by the party’s Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies. The proposal also covers the vice president position.“The Communist Party of China Central Committee proposed to remove the expression that the President and Vice-President of the People’s Republic of China ‘shall serve no more than two consecutive terms’ from the country’s Constitution,” Xinhua said.The Central Committee also proposed inserting “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” into the constitution, Xinhua said in a separate report, referring to Xi’s guiding political thought that is already in the arguably more important Communist Party constitution.Constitutional reform needs to be approved by parliament. That is stacked with members chosen for their loyalty to the party, meaning the reform will not be blocked.There has been persistent speculation that Xi wants to stay on in office past the customary two five-year terms.One of his closest political allies, former top graft buster Wang Qishan, stepped down from the party’s Standing Committee – the seven-man body that runs China – in October.Aged 69, Wang had reached the age at which top officials tend to retire. But he has been chosen as a parliament delegate in 2018 and is likely to become vice president, sources with ties to the leadership and diplomats say.The move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that could set a precedent for Xi to stay on in power after he completes the traditional two terms in office.However, the role of party chief is more senior than that of president. At some point Xi could be given a party position that also enables him to stay on as long as he likes.', 'Rio De Janeiro: The ghosts of Brazil’s dictatorship are stirring in the wake of President Michel Temer’s order for the army to take over policing in Rio de Janeiro. There’s no direct comparison between the Rio operation and the 1964 coup that brought two decades of military rule to Latin America’s biggest country. In this case, the military isn’t overturning a president — it’s just taking charge of Rio state’s security situation after months of escalating crime.However, the echoes have been loud enough to force the government into extraordinary denials. “I’m going to tell you how many marks I give the idea of a military coup: zero,” Temer told Radio Bandeirantes on Friday. The centre-right president went on to say that there was “no mood” in the military or population for a coup. Earlier, the defence minister, Raul Jungmann, stated “there is no risk to democracy…. On the contrary, we are strengthening democracy.” Over the last decade, Rio residents have grown used to seeing camouflaged soldiers support the police in their battle against powerfully armed drug gangs. Some 8,500 troops arrived last July in an ongoing deployment to help with operations in favelas, the latest of which took place on Friday in western Rio. During the 2016 Olym-pics, troops focused on securing tourist areas, patrolling with rifles among the bathing-suit clad crowds of Copac-abana and Ipanema. But the “intervencao,” as it’s called in Portuguese, is different this time.', 'Bhubaneswar: A student from Jammu and Kashmir, studying at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bhubaneswar, has been missing for over a fortnight, police said.Suhail Aijaz, a resident of Kupwara district in the northern state and pursing MBBS at the institute since 2016, left his hostel on February 9, and has been missing since then. The second-year student had informed the authorities of the institute that he was going to Chandigarh with his friends to attend a wedding and would be back on February 17, Commissioner of Police YB Khurania said.The authorities had filed a missing complaint with the police on February 18, a day after the student’s scheduled date of return to the institute.A note has been recovered from the hostel, Khurania said, without elaborating on its content.“Efforts are on to trace the student. We are questioning the institute officials and the friends of the missing student,” Khurania said.He said the youth’s last known location was somewhere in Howrah in West Bengal.“We are in contact with the Howrah police and the CID West Bengal. The particulars of the student have also been shared with them,” he said.Suhail’s father Aijaz Ahmed reached Bhubaneswar and met senior police officials seeking their help in tracing his son. Ahmed told reporters that he had spoken to Suhail over phone for the last time on February 7.He also said that the institute authorities were the first ones to tell him that his son had gone missing.', 'Mumbai: In a shocking incident, six teenagers were killed while one is fighting for his life after a speeding train hit them in Uttar Pradesh’s Hapur, on Sunday night.According to eyewitnesses, the young boys were casually walking across the track when the accident occurred. According to a report in NDTV, the boys (all between 14 to 16 years of age) were daily wage labourers. They were supposed to catch a train from Ghaziabad for a painting assignment in Hyderabad. After missing the train, the 7 friends returned to Pilakhua after midnight.The teenage victims had plugged in earphones, said locals.Residents of the area blocked the tracks staging protests. They claimed that the area is dimly lit at night and no announcements are made for an arriving train, the report said.  Police have reached Sadikpura to tackle the agitated mob.District Magistrate Krishna Karunesh and Superintendent of Police Hemant Kutiyal, visited the spot right after tension erupted in the region.', 'The majority of people believe cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is successful more often than it tends to be in reality, according to a small U.S. study.This overly optimistic view, which may partly stem from seeing happy outcomes in television medical dramas, can get in the way of decision-making and frank conversations about end of life care with doctors, the research team writes in American Journal of Emergency Medicine. CPR is intended to restart a heart that has stopped beating, known as cardiac arrest, which is typically caused by an electrical disturbance in the heart muscle. Although a heart attack is not the same thing – it occurs when blood flow to the heart is partly or completely blocked, often by a clot – a heart attack can also cause the heart to stop beating.Whatever the cause of cardiac arrest, restarting the heart as quickly as possible to get blood flowing to the brain is essential to preventing permanent brain damage. More often than not, cardiac arrest ends in death or severe neurological impairment.The overall rate of survival that leads to hospital discharge for someone who experiences cardiac arrest is about 10.6 per cent, the study authors note. But most participants in the study estimated it at more than 75 per cent. “The majority of patients and non-medical personnel have very unrealistic expectations about the success of CPR as well as the quality of life after patients are revived,” said lead author Lindsey Ouellette, a research assistant at Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine in Grand Rapids.Patients and family members should know about the realistic success rate and survival numbers when planning a living will and considering a “Do Not Resuscitate” order, Ouellette said. “We think it is best to have the latest and most accurate information when dealing with this life-impacting decision, whether or not to undertake or continue CPR,” she told Reuters Health in an email.To gauge perceptions of CPR, the researchers surveyed 1,000 adults at four academic medical centers in Michigan, Illinois and California. Participants included non-critically ill patients and families of patients, who were interviewed during random hospital shifts.In addition to asking about general knowledge of CPR and personal experiences with CPR, the researchers presented participants with several scenarios and asked them to estimate the likelihood of CPR success and patient survival in each case.One scenario involved a 54-year-old who suffered a heart attack at home and required CPR by paramedics. About 72 per cent of the survey participants predicted survival and 65 per cent predicted a complete neurological recovery.In a scenario describing a trauma-related cardiac arrest in an 8-year-old, 71 per cent predicted CPR success and 64 per cent predicted long-term survival of the child. “Many people felt if a person was successfully revived, they would return to ‘normal’ rather than possibly needing lifelong care,” Ouellette said.At the same time, more than 70 per cent of respondents said they watched TV medical dramas regularly, and 12 per cent said these shows were a reliable source of health information. “Tempering unrealistic expectations may not make for ‘good TV,’ but perhaps we can get a better idea of just how these dramas may impact the views people hold about CPR and other aspects of medicine,” she said. “People think about CPR as a miracle, but it’s another medical act,” said Dr. Juan Ruiz-Garcia of Hospital Universitario de Torrejon in Madrid who wasn’t involved in the study. “I’m not really sure what people would choose if they knew the real prognosis of it,” he told Reuters Health by phone.CPR should be part of the conversation about end-of-life care and advanced directives among families, said Carolyn Bradley of Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. “When doing CPR at a hospital, we tend to move the family away, but we’ve created a situation where families may not be there for the final moments,” she said in a phone interview. “Have a critical conversation with your health care provider and go with questions about what would happen during CPR,” she said. “What does it look like? What happens to my body? Who will be around? It could be the end-of-life. Statistically, it is.”', 'Johannesburg:  South African special police unit Hawks have arrested an Indian-origin woman and her partner, both allegedly linked to ISIS, on charges of abducting a British couple.Fatima Patel and Safydeen Aslam Del Vecchio also face charges of robbery and theft after they went on a spending spree using the couples’ credit cards, building up a stash of jewellery, camping equipment and electronic devices which were found at a remote location where an ISIS flag was being flown. The Hawks declined to provide any further information due to the sensitive nature of the case as the search continues for the couple whose vehicle was found abandoned more than 300 km away from where they were last seen on February 9.But the weekly Sunday Times, quoting a charge sheet after their court appearance, reported that Patel and Del Vecchio also stand accused of contravening the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorism and Related Activities Act by hoisting an ISIS flag at a modest homestead in a rural area.Del Vecchio also faces another terrorism-related charge for allegedly participating in “extremist web forums that support ISIS and offering to supply phone numbers and sim cards that are not traceable.”Yousha Tayob, the lawyer representing Patel and Del Vecchio, confirmed that the pair had appeared in the court and were remanded in custody at Westville Prison in KwaZulu-Natal province.The incident had prompted the British government to issue a travel advisory about possible terrorist attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa, but local Muslim organisations have dismissed this as an “overreaction”.Ebrahim Deen of the Afro-Middle East Centre told the weekly that South African Muslims posed no threat to travellers and that the incident was more related to crime than an ISIS attack.“Muslims are largely integrated in (South African) society, are not disillusioned and they face little discrimination like in Europe and elsewhere,” he said.Martin Ewi of the Institute for Security Studies said South Africa was regarded as a “logistics base” for terror cells in transit, and is not traditionally a target for attacks, although the arrests of Patel and Del Vecchio confirmed the presence of an active terror cell in South Africa.“We in the counter-terror fraternity suspected that they were working as members of an active cell, and the kidnapping will confirm the presence of an active IS cell,” Ewi said.', 'Guwahati: The ruling Congress party is leaving no stone unturned to defeat the anti-incumbency in the frontier state of Meghalaya by launching a direct attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accusing him of pursuing the agenda of “Hindutva”.A day after releasing the manifesto of the party committing at least one job to each family, leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s special interest in North Eastern Region was aimed at strengthening Rashtriya Swayamseak Sangh (RSS) base in the Christian dominated area. Azad, while addressing a public rally in the state, said, “BJP is following same strategy in both—-Kashmir and Northeastern states. They want to propagate Hindutva in Meghalaya as well.”Pointing out that the BJP is anti-Christian, Azad said that they follow the dictate of their mentor RSS which has the agenda of controlling the Christian states.Questioning the secular credential of NDA government, the veteran Congress leader said, “In Uttar Pradesh, fridges in Muslim households were checked whether it had meat of different type which they don’t like same thing is going to happen here in Meghalaya if they somehow manage to come into power.”Azad who was addressing the public rally in Rilbong in South Shillong constituency -one of the five general seats in Meghalaya where a direct contest is between BJP and Congress, said that Congress has always been in the forefront of preserving the unique tribal identity of the Northeastern states.Facing a strong anti-incumbency of eight years in the state, the ruling Congress party in its manifesto has pledged to create three lakh new jobs, and assured to provide one job to every household. The party has also committed to set up a transparent and effective public delivery system and if voted to power it would enhance health care facilities and education.The party also proposed that it would provide a lump sum amount of Rs 15000 as a wedding assistance to orphaned girl child. “We will set a new benchmark of transparent and effective public delivery system which will ensure that the governance is pro people,” the Congress party pledged in its manifesto, which was released by Congress General Secretary CP Joshi along with the state office bearers at Shillong.Proposing to set up an exclusive market for women at Shillong, Tura and Jowai, where the retailers would be women only, the Congress party in its manifesto said, “No outlaw will be allowed to disturb the peace of the state. We will have ‘zero tolerance; to any desperate act of militancy.”', 'Mumbai: Veteran actor Sridevi’s mortal remains will be brought back to India only after the family gets the autopsy report from a hospital in Dubai, where she died of a cardiac arrest on Sunday.The report is expected by 11 am following which the formalities to bring the mortal remains to the country will be initiated. Officials informed as per usual protocols, these tests take up to 24 hours in the case a person has died outside a hospital in Dubai.Also read: ‘Suddenly she becomes a mere body?’ Rishi Kapoor slams media over Sridevi’s deathOfficials revealed that Sridevi’s autopsy is complete, her family is now awaiting laboratory reports conducted by the General Department of Forensic Evidence, Dubai.This is contrary to reports claiming that the funeral was to take place at the Pawan Hans crematorium at 11 am on Monday.The mortal remains will be brought back in a chartered flight arranged by businessman Anil Ambani.The country woke up to the shocking news of the actress’ death at a Dubai hotel on Sunday and tributes have been pouring in on social media.An official statement from the family’s team read: “Boney Kapoor, Jhanvi, Khushi and the entire Kapoor, Ayyappan and Marwah family is deeply bereaved and shocked with the untimely loss of Sridevi Kapoor. They thank the entire media for their prayers, support and sensitivity during their time of grief.“Late Sridevi Kapoor’s body will arrive in India tomorrow (Monday).

In a meeting with the South’s President Moon Jae-in, the North’s delegation “agreed that inter-Korea talks and North-US relations should improve together”, the Blue House said in a statement.

Sameer, who had clinched the Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold last year and reached the finals at 2016 Hong Kong Super Series, thus lifted his first title of the season and joined fellow Indians Kidambi Srikanth and HS Prannoy, who had won the title in 2015 and 2016.“I am very happy to win the title. I was confident of doing well but I didn’t expect an easy final. I had beaten him narrowly in Hong Kong, so I knew he is a difficult player to beat but he is not 100 percent fit yet as he is coming back from an injury. I had a word with him after the match and he told me he is not 100%, so it is a good result for him as well to reach the final,” Sameer told PTI after his victory.Up against Jorgensen, who made a comeback this season after missing in action for more than seven months following a heel injury, Sameer showed great touch and control to emerge victories in the 36-minute contest.Sameer opened up a 3-0 lead early and capitalised on it to enter the break with a 11-7 advantage. He never gave an inch to his rival to make a comeback.Jorgensen won a video referral after the interval and narrowed the gap to 10-12 but Sameer jumped to 17-10 with five straight points before pocketing the opening game comfortably when the Danish shuttler hit the net. The first game lasted 17 minutes.In the second game, the duo split the first 10 points before Sameer produced a series of powerful cross court smashes and aided by a few miscued shots by his rival moved to an advantage of 11-6 at the lemon break.Jorgensen constructed the next two rallies well to fetch two points but a net error handed the serve back to the Indian. The Dane left the shuttle but lost the video referral by a narrow margin. Sameer mixed the shots well and used a deceptive return to move to 14-9.A lucky net chord gave him another point as Sameer inched closer to the title when Jorgensen hit wide. Sameer sent the shuttle out and then struggled with a low lift at the forecourt to give two points to his rival.Jorgensen tried to slow the pace and induce errors from Sameer but he soon sent the shuttle wide twice. The first gave Sameer a seven match points, while the second he challenged even as Sameer sprawled on the court and lifted his arms in celebration.', 'Cape Town: Indian captain Virat Kohli refused to bask in his team’s success in South Africa as he received the International Cricket Council Test championship mace for the second year running.Somewhat incongruously, the mace was presented to Kohli on Saturday at the end of a triumphant limited overs campaign. India won a one-day international series 5-1 and a Twenty20 series 2-1. Perhaps it was a reminder to Kohli that second-ranked South Africa had won a Test series at the start of the tour.“I’d say we are still 80 percent,” Kohli said of the Test team as he looked forward to major challenges in coming tours of England and Australia later this year.“When we are able to achieve what we want to in the two tours, we’ll be more content. But our 80 per cent is also exciting. To be a world-class side, you have to be 100 per cent.”Although the cut-off date for the ICC rankings only comes in April, India cannot be overtaken. Apart from the mace and the glory India will collect a million dollars in prize money.Kohli left South Africa on Sunday having dazzled with his batting artistry and his no-holds-barred captaincy style.It is doubtful whether any visiting captain in modern times has made a greater impact than Kohli, who stated on arrival that his India team feared no opposition nor any conditions. “We look at the pitch and adapt to the conditions,” he said. “Every game is a home game. It’s as simple as that.”His early press conference set the tone for the tour. Articulate, occasionally combative with journalists who challenged, for instance, his selection policies, Kohli stayed true to his mantra of playing positive cricket and not taking a backward step.He did not complain about the seam-friendly Test pitches prepared for South Africa’s fast bowlers, even though ICC match referee Chris Broad rated the pitches for the first two Tests “average” and his successor Andy Pycroft condemned the pitch used for the third Test at the Wanderers as “poor”.Kohli’s response was that sub-standard pitches helped his bowlers as much as they helped the South Africans. Although India lost the first two Tests, they were competitive in both and made the best of the worst conditions by winning the third Test.Record runs haul:Then they outclassed South Africa in the white ball games.Kohli was the leading run-scorer for either side in both the Tests and one-day games. He showed resolve, sound technique and courage in difficult conditions in the Tests, scoring 286 runs, including the only century of the series, at an average of 47.66.He exploded on more batsmen-friendly pitches in the one-dayers, striking a world record bilateral series total of 558 runs at a staggering average of 186.00, scoring at a fraction under a run a ball.His teammates responded to Kohli’s example. The bowlers, in particular, were outstanding. Given his chance in the Tests, Jasprit Bumrah showed he was much more than a good one-day bowler, while Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar all troubled the South African batsmen.In the one-day games, India’s bold gambit of picking two wrist spinners in Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal proved a master stroke.Kohli’s form obscured flaws in the rest of the Indian batting. None of the other specialist batsmen averaged 30 in the Tests but Shikhar Dhawan shone in the one-day matches. Rohit Sharma managed a single impressive innings, a century in the fifth one-day international after Kohli was out for 36, his lowest score of the series.Although Kohli bristled at the suggestion that India did not select their best possible side for the first two Tests, Ajinkya Rahane’s batting in the third Test suggested he should have played earlier, while Kumar’s omission for the second Test was baffling.Kohli and several other senior players have been rested for a triangular T20 series starting in Sri Lanka on March 6. The lucrative interlude of the Indian Premier League starts in April. Kohli has shown that ambition is a stronger driving force than money – and he expects his teammates to follow his example.', 'Mumbai: Legendary Stefan Edberg says the game of tennis has become better with technology assisting its evolution. Edberg, winner of six Grand Slams including two Wimbledon titles, said there is lot of information available which can be used to train in much better way.“Tennis has changed, it is better today. It is more physical, played a little bit quicker and it is due to technology with racquets with strings, the knowledge is better today (on) how to train, the nutrition is better today and lot of things have improved,” Edberg told PTI in an interaction. The Swede, known for his brilliant serve and volley game, also said if anyone who can equal Roger Federer’s feat of winning 20 Grand Slams are Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Federer currently holds the world record for winning 20 Grand Slams in men’s singles and has appeared in 30 finals. At 36, he is also the oldest world number one player.“There have been a lot of great players throughout here, but if you look at his (Roger Federer’s) record, the most at number one (for) number of weeks, the most grand slams. He is probably the greatest players of all-times,” Edberg, who was world number one for 72 weeks, said.“Is there another player who could do the same, it’s Rafael Nadal, he is still young enough to get up there, if he can stay healthy. And you have Novak Djokovic who has won lot of grand slams, so those are the two players who have a chance to get to 20 Grand Slams but it’s a long long way and it is nearly impossible, and apart from that it’s going to take another 10-15 years before anybody has a chance to achieve the same,” he said.“Obviously you had Rod Laver going back, who didn’t play professional circuit for number of years, he is one of the legends, I have seen them all play, from (John) McEnroe, (Bjorn) Borg on television of course, (but) he (Federer) probably stands out as of now,” said the Swedish player.While Nadal has won 16 Grand Slams in men’s singles, Djokovic has won 12 Grand Slams. Edberg, who worked with Federer as a coach for a brief period, also said that what the Swiss player has achieved was almost impossible.“Roger Federer is quite an astonishing tennis player and to reach number one at this stage of (his) career and at this age, it’s probably like a dream in many ways, may be for himself.“He had an opportunity couple of years ago, but Djokovic was too strong and then suddenly what happened after 2016, he had injury, had to have his operation and coming back with a fresh mind. Not too many expectations and the comeback he had here.“I don’t think anybody could have believed that this could have happen. Possibly he would have been happy with one Grand Slam more, but now he has won three in 12 months, it’s incredible, it’s almost impossible to do what he has done but he has surprised us,” Edberg added. Federer has started the 2018 on a high note by winning the Australian Open. The Swede is in the city as a mentor for Times of India Sports Awards (TOISA), to be held on Monday.', 'Cape Town: India never backed down in adverse situations and played an aggressive brand of cricket to emerge as deserving winners in the limited over series, said stand-in captain Rohit Sharma.“We will take these limited-overs trophies, throughout the series we played with a lot of aggression. As a group, we never back down from any situation. That is the reason we are standing here as winners,” Rohit said after India beat South Africa by seven runs to clinch the series 2-1 on Saturday. Rohit also lauded his bowlers for a clinical performance.“We discussed certain plans and it worked today. The idea was to keep the ball on the stumps and we kept it tight in the first six overs. Credit to the new-ball bowlers. It was a complete bowling performance,” he said.“To be honest, we were 15 runs short. Because the way the first half went, I thought we lost our way in the end. These things happen and we learn from it. I thought it was a decent score and the bowlers did the job for us. I hope games like these teach us a lot of things.”JP Duminy, South Africa’s stand-in captain credited India for dominating the powerplays with both bat and ball.“They bowled pretty well in the Powerplay, and we just couldn’t get the boundaries. The difference from their batting Powerplay and ours was 30 runs. I definitely thought 170 was chaseable,” he said.“The slower balls and the knuckle balls from them worked. I am proud of the way the guys fought, especially Jonker. It is amazing to see a lot of talent coming through. All credit to India, outstanding white-ball tour for them.”Raina, who was adjudged the Man of the Match for scoring 43 off 27 balls and taking one wicket for 27 in three overs, credited skipper Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri for showing confidence in him.“Especially in the first overs, you need to show intent. Thanks to Virat and Ravi bhai, they gave me the licence. The way we played, the dressing room atmosphere is so calm.“The last we have done in two-and-a-half months, no team has done it in a long time. Two lefties at the crease, I got a ball, and working on it.”Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was awarded the Man of the Series, said IPL helped him to hone his skills in the shorter format.“Yes, I really enjoyed this tour. I was very happy with my preparation. First of all thanks to IPL, it has made an Indian bowler a thinking bowler,” said Kumar, who took seven wickets, including a five-wicket haul, in the three-match T20 International series.“It is important not to give too many runs in the first six overs. I always try to keep it simple. I hardly get these kind of wickets in India and I enjoyed this.”', 'Mumbai: The rupee strengthened by 6 paise to 64.67 against the dollar at the forex market on Monday on fresh selling of the American currency by exporters and banks amid strength in domestic equities.Dealers said dollar’s weakness against other currencies overseas and early gains in domestic equity markets supported the rupee.

The case pertains to Commodore Lokesh Batra (Retd) who had sought to know details of bills, invoices and other records related to abroad visits of Prime Minister between Financial Years 2013-14 and 2016-17.During the hearing, Batra said he was provided incomplete information by the ministry after which he approached the Commission which is the top appellate authority in matters pertaining to the Right to Information Act.He said he wanted the general public to be informed at what stage or with which public authority these bills and invoices are pending for payment.“Air India is a cash-strapped airline that does not make money. Therefore, delay in settling these bills would also include sizable interest figure(s), which needs to be paid at the expense of taxpayers’ money,” Batra said.Batra said these records cannot be brushed aside in the garb of national security — a clause which can be cited by a public authority to deny requested information — because these are in the nature of the liabilities of the consumer(s) to pay back for the services rendered by Air India.After hearing both sides, Mathur said payment of outstanding dues would ultimately require collating of these bills and invoices and rejected the argument of the MEA that collation would disproportionately divert its resources.He said even if payment was made against these bills, it would have been done after compiling of bills/invoices.“Further, whatever payment is to be made, it needs to be done after collecting the bills/invoices. In view of this, the Commission is of the opinion that the respondent (MEA) should provide to the appellant (Batra) travel bills relating to Air India from FYs. 2013-14 to 2016-17,” he said.', 'US President Donald Trump is not a happy with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. For the second time in two weeks, Trump complained about India’s tariffs on the import of motorcycles. This time, however, Trump mimicked Modi’s ‘namaste’ while delivering his complaint.Trump had on February 14, complained during a meeting with US lawmakers that India’s tariff on the import of American motorcycles – specifically Harley-Davidsons – was too high. He returned to the complaint on Monday.“When I spoke to PM (Modi) he said we are lowering it to 50% but so far we are getting nothing. He gets 50%, he thinks, he is doing us a favour, but that is not a favour,” complained Trump at a meeting of the governors of US states at the White House.“I wasn’t sure – he said it so beautifully. He’s a beautiful man. And he said, ‘I just want to inform you that we have reduced it to 75, but we have further reduced it to 50’. And I said, huh. What do I say? Am I supposed to be thrilled?” said Trump, imitating Modi by holding his palms in a ‘namste’ and speaking in a low and serious voice.Thankfully, the insults stopped there and he did not do his ‘Indian accent’ this time.Trump had earlier threatened to descend to an ‘eye-for-an-eye’ solution to the impasse over the import tariff on American motorcycles in India. He had threatened to impose a reciprocal tariff on the import on India-made motorcycles in the US.Trump is no stranger to making threats to other countries when it comes to trade, and complaining that every country on earth takes advantage of the US. He had done so throughout his campaign, against China for instance. But he is not known for following up on his threats, and has done little to bring his threats to fruition so far.Trump’s complaining and threatening against India on the issue of motorcycle import tariffs is part of his blow-hot-blow-cold relationship with the Asian giant. He is as prone to hyperbolic praise of New Delhi as he is to complaining about it, as seen by his blaming India and China for the US pulling out of its commitments to the Paris climate accord.', 'New Delhi: According to a report by social media giant Facebook it said that India is ranked 47th out of 86 countries when it comes to inclusive internet and connectivity for all due to low usage and poor quality.Facebook, which commissioned the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to create a comprehensive “Inclusive Internet Index,” found India in the middle of Asian countries (12th out of 23) when it comes to connectivity.“India places at or near the top of the lower-middle-income bracket on most indicators, except for availability, where it is 13th out of 23, compromised by low usage and poor quality despite relatively strong infrastructure,” the report said.The EIU is a British business within the Economist Group, providing forecasting and advisory services through research and analysis. This year’s index covered 91 percent of the world`s population and an expanded data set of 86 countries, up from 75 countries in 2017.Across the indexed countries, on average, men are 33.5 percent more likely to have Internet access than women. “The gap is even larger in low-income countries, which have an average gender access gap of 80.2 percent compared with 3.7 percent among high-income countries,” said Molly Jackman, Public Policy Research Manager at Facebook. The index assessed a country`s Internet inclusion across four categories: availability, affordability, relevance and readiness. “Bringing people online can offer life-changing opportunities, but there are still approximately 3.8 billion people without Internet access. At Facebook, we`re working to change that,” added Robert Pepper, Head of Global Connectivity Policy at Facebook, in a blog post. “Global connectivity has increased 8.3 percent and more people are connected than ever before. While this progress is encouraging, we are still far from achieving full Internet inclusivity,” Pepper added.According to the index, the Internet is empowering, especially to citizens in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Nearly 67 percent of survey respondents believe that access to the Internet is a human right. “Not only do people say that the Internet helped them become more confident to express themselves, but the majority of respondents also say that the Internet has helped them become more independent and economically empowered,” the index noted.Emerging markets, especially in Africa, experienced the fastest and greatest progress over the last year. According to Facebook, mobile Internet services are increasingly vital in many low-income countries.“In some countries, fixed-line Internet access is too expensive or inaccessible – that’s why mobile services are critical. The index reveals that coverage of 4G networking services grew significantly as networks in low-income countries are being upgraded,” Facebook said. In fact, the average 4G coverage rate for low-income countries increased year-over-year from 9.1 percent to 17.3 percent.The cost of accessing the Internet is also falling. Also, the cost of mobile broadband data plans in lower-income countries decreased about 17.3 percent from last year. “Overall, however, people are still devoting too much of their earnings on Internet access relative to their income level,” the index noted.', 'New Delhi: An Indian Administrative Services (IAS) aspirant committed suicide by hanging himself in Ber Sarai area here, after having failed the exam.The victim, identified as Samrat Chauhan, was allegedly depressed after having failed the examination and decided to hang himself, as per his suicide note.“I used to talk to him every day at 8.30 pm.

Police have recorded the statement of her husband, Boney Kapoor, and local media reports say he is not likely to be interrogated.Sridevi had died on February 24, and it was initially reported that she died of cardiac arrest. An autopsy concluded that she had “accidentally drowned” in the bath tub of her hotel room. Because of the findings of this autopsy, Sridevi’s death was referred to the Dubai Public Prosecution for further investigation.UAE media reported that these are part of regular procedures and categorically stated that Boney Kapoor or any other family members are not being interrogated, as had been reported earlier.Boney had flown to Dubai from Mumbai and went to Sridevi’s room at the Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel at around 5:30 pm on Saturday to surprise her with dinner, a source close to the family told the Khaleej Times. He reportedly woke her up and the couple chatted for about 15 minutes.The reports said Sridevi then went to the washroom. After 15 minutes, had passed and Sridevi did not come out, Boney knocked on the door to check on her. When he got no response, he forced open the door to find the legendary actor lying motionless in the bathtub full of water, the source said.Sridevi, Boney Kapoor, and their younger daughter, Khushi Kapoor, were in Ras Al Khaimah, another emirate of the UAE, last week to celebrate the wedding of her actor-nephew Mohit Marwah.The frenzied reporting over the case had earlier prompted India’s Ambassador to the UAE,  Navdeep Suri, to call for restraint.The media interest in untimely demise of #Sridevi is understandable.

We are discussing development under the leadership of women,” he said.He then went on to talk about the role that artificial intelligence and technology can play in ensuring the welfare of the poor and underprivileged.“I urge the scientists to find ways in which we can enhance lives of our ‘divyang’ brothers & sisters through artificial intelligence,” he said.“Science and technology are value-neutral,” the Prime Minister said, “It depends on us what work we want a machine to do. Hence, human objectivity becomes important.”Modi then went on to laud the spirit of inquiry, saying one must not rest till “one gets the answer to all the questions.”Modi also thanked the forces that reach out for rescue operations immediately after disasters happen.“We have many unnamed, unsung heroes in the Fire and Rescue services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces and in the Paramilitary forces who bravely reach out during emergencies without caring about their lives,” said Modi.He also appreciated organisations like NCC and Scouts who also help during such situations.The Prime Minister went on to say that apart from purely natural disasters, most calamities occur because people are not vigilant enough and do not follow the rules.“We must become a risk-conscious society, understand values of safety. In our culture, we often speak about the protection of values, but we also have to understand values of safety. We must make it a part of our lives,” he said.The Prime Minister also stressed the importance of biodegradable wastes, announcing the “GOBAR dhan” (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources) initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission, which will encourage the use of dung, farm waste, kitchen waste for biogas energy.“New jobs would be created through #waste collection and transportation. Online trading platform would be set up to run ‘Gobar Dhan Yojana’ smoothly; it will connect farmers to buyers,” said Modi.He lauded the Trash Mahotsav that recently took place in Chattisgarh.The objective behind it was to utilise waste creatively & to spread awareness about ways to reuse garbage.Modi also congratulated people of Elephanta Islands as three villages get electricity for the first time after spending 70 years in darkness, saying it was in a new phase of development.He ended his speech with Holi greetings.', 'New Delhi: India’s premier defence research institute DRDO on Sunday carried out “successful” test flight of its Rustom 2 drone, a medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), at Chalakere in Karnataka’s Chitradurga district.Rustom 2 is being developed on the lines of predator drones of the US to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) roles for the armed forces with an endurance of 24 hours, officials said.“DRDO successfully flew its Rustom 2 today at its Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) at Chalakere at Chitradurga. This flight assumes significance due to the fact that this is the first flight in user configuration with higher power engine,” a statement read.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said the test flight was “successful” and all its parameters were “normal”.Rustom 2 is capable of carrying different combinations of payloads like synthetic aperture radar, electronic intelligence systems and situational awareness payloads, officials said.DRDO chairman S Christopher, its Director General of Aeronautical System CP Ramanarayanan, DG Electronics and Communication Systems J Manjula and other senior scientists witnessed the test flight.The around Rs 1,500-crore UAV project was initiated considering requirement of the the Army, Navy and Air Force.

Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business group, said anyone at this stage in the decade-old industry’s history that had less than 10 per cent market share was losing money.Huawei is the world’s third-biggest smartphone maker, trailing leaders Samsung and Apple, with a 10.2 per cent market share in the fourth quarter, according to market surveys from IDC and Strategy Analytics. “In the future, only three to four vendors can survive, maybe only less than four,” Yu told reporters following a product launch event held ahead of the Mobile World Congress. He said other, smaller Chinese vendors were consolidating, and most would disappear, as they did not have enough resources to invest in the same levels of research and development, marketing and branding needed to gain global scale.“If your market share is less than 10 per cent you cannot be profitable. Over at 10 per cent, at least, you can break even (and) over 15 per cent you can make money,” he said.He said Huawei’s smartphone business grew by around 30 per cent in the last year, and would grow even faster this year, with strong growth in both January and so far this month.Huawei could become the second biggest smartphone maker this year or next, and sooner or later could be No.1, he said, speaking after his company unveiled a new notebook PC and two Android tablets. It declined to launch a new flagship smartphone as it has done in the past at the Mobile World conference in Barcelona. Instead, it is set to launch its new flagship P20 smartphone at a standalone event in Paris next month, where Yu said Huawei would showcase “big and bold” innovation in camera technology.The device will compete head-to-head with Samsung’s new Galaxy S9 – launched here on Sunday – and Apple’s iPhone X. Looking ahead to next-generation mobile networks set to roll out starting later this year in several major markets, Huawei also unveiled 5G versions of a consumer network router, its own chipset for phones. Yu said Huawei will launch its first 5G-ready smartphone either in the third- or fourth-quarter, most likely in its Mate line of devices.', 'After being spied more than once, the covers have finally been lifted off Nissan’s all-new Terra SUV. This new SUV, revealed in China, is a left-hand drive model and is likely to head into right-hand drive markets as well in the near future.The Nissan Terra is based on a ladder-frame architecture, shared with the popular Navara pickup and the Mercedes X-class.  Nissan will showcase the new Terra SUV for the first time to the general public at the upcoming Beijing Motor show in China.The new Nissan SUV, along with its underpinnings, also shares some exterior bits with the Navara and even on the inside, the dashboard is more or less the same as the pickup.

Despite his 633 runs (highest in the history National One Dayers) scored in the championship till date, tomorrow will be the day where his temperament will be scrutinised more than his technique.', 'Palakkad: The Mannarkkad police on Monday arrested five CPI men in connection with the murder of IUML activist Safeer, 22, on Sunday night.

The ruling Communist Party on Sunday proposed to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to just two terms in office, meaning Xi, who also heads the party and the military, might never have to retire.The proposal, which will be passed by delegates loyal to the party at next month’s annual meeting of China’s largely rubber stamp parliament, is part of a package of amendments to the country’s constitution.It will also add Xi’s political thought to the constitution, already added to the party constitution in 2017, and set a legal framework for a super anti-corruption superbody, as well as more broadly strengthen the party’s tight grip on power.But it seems the party will have its work cut out trying to convince some in China, where Xi is actually very popular thanks in part to his war on graft, that the move will not end up giving Xi too much power.“Argh, we’re going to become North Korea,” wrote one Weibo user, where the Kim dynasty has ruled since the late 1940s. Kim Il Sung founded North Korea in 1948 and his family has ruled it ever since.“We’re following the example of our neighbour,’ wrote another user.The comments were removed late on Sunday evening after Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, began blocking the search term “two term limit”.Widely read state-run newspaper the Global Times, in an editorial carried online late Sunday and published on Monday, said the change did not mean the president will stay in office for ever, though it did not offer much explanation.“Since reform and opening up, China, led by the Communist Party, has successfully resolved and will continue to effectively resolve the issue of party and national leadership replacement in a law-abiding and orderly manner,” it said, referring to landmark economic reforms that begun four decades ago.The party’s official People’s Daily reprinted a long article by Xinhua news agency saying most people supported the constitutional amendments, quoting a variety of people proffering support.“The broad part of officials and the masses say that they hoped this constitutional reform is passed,” it wrote.The WeChat account of the People’s Daily, after initially posting a flurry of positive comments under its article, then disabled the comments section completely late on Sunday. It was back again by Monday, complete with remarks lauding the party.The overseas edition of the same paper’s WeChat account removed entirely an article focusing on the term limits, replacing it with the lengthy Xinhua report summing up all the amendment proposals.In one confusing moment for many Chinese, Xinhua initially only reported the news in English.The decision has also unsettled some in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, where authorities have been trying to rein in a pro-democracy movement.“This move, which would allow for a single individual to amass and accumulate political power, means that China would again have a dictator as her head of state – Xi Jinping,” said Joshua Wong, one of the movement’s leaders.“The law may exist in China in form, but this just proves that the Chinese law exists to serve the individual and the party’s purposes.”China is likely though to see any such criticism as a plot against the party.“Every time China deliberates on reforms and key decisions, effect on public opinion is worth pondering,” the Global Times wrote. “Misinformation and external forces’ meddling will affect public opinion in China.”', 'A quiet library in Middlesex stood still in time and horror as a man stepped in, followed an unsuspecting woman and stabbed her to death with a 10-inch long hunting knife.Library patrons watched in shock as the suspect, 23-years-old Jeffrey Yao from Massachusetts town stabbed the woman on her head, chest and torso, the Washington Post reported. Another 77-years-old man was stabbed in the arm as well as the people present rushed to the staggering woman’s help in a bid to stop the attacker. His injuries are minor.The woman, whose name has not been released, succumbed to her injuries and died at the hospital later. Officials said they are waiting to notify her next of kin before making her name public.The incident reportedly took place around 10:30 a.m.Reasons for the attack remain unknown. Yao’s neighbours told the Boston Herald that his behaviour “was increasingly erratic,” while some added they were worried he “will kill somebody.”One neighbour who chose to remain anonymous claimed that Yao had tried to “smash our door down” at 3 a.m. in 2017. Another neighbour, Leslie Luongo said she was afraid of Yao and ‘would run to her car’ while leaving for work.Ann Wirtanen, the library’s director, announced that the library will be closed “until at least Tuesday,” in a statement posted on Facebook.Yao has been arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder. He is being held without bail until his arraignment on Monday.', 'Dhaka: A court in Bangladesh on Monday extended the bail of imprisoned ex-prime minister and main opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia until March 13 in a graft case, a day after the High Court deferred the judgement on a separate bail plea in a corruption case, media reports said.The 72-year-old three-time former prime minister was jailed for five years on February 8 in connection with the embezzlement of 21 million taka (about USD 250,000) in foreign donations meant for the Zia Orphanage Trust, named after her late husband Ziaur Rahman, a military ruler-turned-politician. The Dhaka Special Judge’s Court-5 set March 13 as the date for the next hearing of arguments in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case and extended the bail of Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief, until then, bdnews24 reported.“The court has set March 13 and March 14 for the next two days of arguments. Zia’s bail has been extended until March 13,” her lawyer Nuruzzaman Tapan was quoted as saying in the report.On Sunday, the High Court deferred the judgment on her bail petition, saying it would decide after receiving necessary papers from the lower court which sentenced her to five years in jail in February.The Zia Charitable Trust graft case, filed in August 2011, accuses four persons, including Zia of abusing power to raise funds for the trust from unknown sources.The three others are: Harris Chowdhury, political secretary of then prime minister Zia between 2001 and 2006; Ziaul Islam Munna, Assistant Private Secretary (APS) to Harris; and Monirul Islam Khan, APS of former Dhaka city mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka. The corruption case is one of dozens pending against Zia, who has been a rival to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for decades.The charges against Zia had led to her boycotting polls in 2014, which triggered widespread protests at the time.Currently, 34 cases are pending against Zia in various courts across the country, including the Zia Orphanage Trust and Zia Charitable Trust graft cases, the report said. The BNP has claimed that the cases are politically-motivated to keep its party chief out of the national elections, set for December.', 'Sydney: A conservative rural politician who once expressed strong anti-gay views was Monday chosen to replace scandal-plagued Barnaby Joyce as Australia’s deputy prime minister after he resigned over an affair with his now-pregnant aide.Michael McCormack, 53, was chosen by the Nationals — the junior partner in the governing Liberal-National coalition — to take over as leader and deputy PM in an internal party vote. “We are the party for small business and farmers and we want to make sure that continues and that can only continue with a close relationship with the Liberals,” McCormack told reporters in Canberra after winning the vote.“Look forward to having a good discussion with (Prime Minister and Liberals leader) Malcolm Turnbull in a few moments,” he added.McCormack, who had been the veterans’ affairs minister, was sworn in as deputy PM and infrastructure minister shortly after his appointment.He was widely expected to win the leadership role after other Nationals MPs withdrew from the race.Maverick Queensland MP George Christensen launched a late bid for the leadership, but was defeated. The vote count was not released.McCormack is not as well-known as Joyce, who made international headlines for threatening to euthanise Hollywood star Johnny Depp’s dogs over a quarantine violation.But he is seen as a safe pair of hands as the Liberal and National parties seek to repair their relationship after the Joyce scandal.Tensions between the two parties rose after 50-year-old Joyce’s affair with ex-staffer Vikki Campion, 33, was splashed across the frontpage of Sydney’s Daily Telegraph in early February.Revelations about the affair and allegations that Joyce breached ministerial rules made daily headlines, prompting Turnbull to harshly criticise his deputy’s behaviour and impose a formal ban on sex between ministers and their staff.Also Read: Australian PM bans sex among ministers after deputy’s affairJoyce in turn slammed Turnbull’s comments as “inept” and initially refused to step down, before resigning Friday after a separate sexual harassment complaint was lodged against him. He denied the allegation.Turnbull welcomed McCormack’s appointment, saying he expected the more than 70-year coalition between the two parties would continue under his leadership.The coalition has endured a tumultuous few months, with the scandal coming on the heels of a dual citizenship crisis that involved some of its lawmakers, including Joyce, and threatened its wafer-thin parliamentary majority.McCormack, first elected to the lower House of Representatives in 2010 representing the rural region of Riverina in southwest New South Wales state, is not without controversy.More than two decades ago as a local newspaper editor he wrote a column in which he described homosexuality as “sordid behaviour”.In August, as he oversaw a voluntary nationwide postal vote on same-sex marriage as the minister in charge of the government agency running the poll, he “apologised wholeheartedly for the comments at the time”.McCormack later voted in parliament in support of amending the Marriage Act to legalise gay unions.', 'Shillong: Voting began in  the Christian-dominated states of Nagaland and Meghalaya on Tuesday.

Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday kicked off his campaign for the next election by announcing Rs 5 lakh medical insurance for farmers. He chose Karimnagar town, which played a crucial role in the Telangana  agitation, to make the announcement. He recalled that the TRS’ first meeting ‘Simha Garjana’ was organised in Karimnagar in 2001 demanding that the Central government create a separate Telangana state. Addressing the Regional Rythu Samanvaya Committees awareness meeting, he announced that 70 lakh farmers would be brought under insurance cover, with the state government paying the premium.    The Telangana Rashtra Samiti is probably the first political party in the country that has an accident insurance scheme for farmers. TRS members have been getting insurance cover for some time and families of those who died in accidents have been paid the insurance. Mr Rao said the modalities of the insurance scheme are being worked out. He said that nearly 1.62 lakh acres of land is under cultivation in Telangana.“Revolutionary changes are likely to take place in agriculture in Telangana with the decisions being taken by the state government to make agriculture profitable, unlike in the past,” he said. He said the mandal level Rythu Samanvaya Committees will offer MSP for crops purchased from  farmers if the market price was poor and the committees will sell the produce whenever the price increases in the internal or national markets.Officials estimated that at Rs 1,000 per farmer, the insurance scheme will cost the state exchequer Rs 700 crore per year. The `8,000 per acre handout to farmers will cost the state Rs 12,000 crore per year, taking the total burden to Rs 12,700 crore per year, exclusively for the benefit of farmers.', 'New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke protocol yet again as he went to the airport to receive Jordan’s King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, who arrived here on a three-day state visit to India on Tuesday.Modi welcomed King Abdullah with a warm hug as he alighted from the aircraftLater, in a tweet, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar confirmed that PM Modi, deviated from protocol to welcome His Majesty Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein of Jordan at the airport.“India attaches great importance to its ties with Jordan,” Kumar said.India welcomes His Majesty @KingAbdullahII Ibn Al Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of #Jordan on his State Visit.

He has talked about it often – staying in office for eight years – and set up a fund raising organisation even before he took charge as president in 2017. But when he announced that Brad Parscale would be his campaign chief, it was the most concrete announcement yet.The announcement was made by Eric Trump, the president’s son, in a prepared statement on Tuesday. “Brad is an amazing talent and was pivotal to our success in 2016. He has our family’s complete trust and is the perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign.”And that is not just the typical hyperbole that Trump and those around him are prone to. Parscale had been the digital director of Trump’s successful and surprise 2016 bid for the White House. He is credited with using social media platforms, especially Facebook, as a crunching force multiplier to devastating effect against Democrat Hillary Clinton.US media reports said Parscale has been tasked with building up the manpower and infrastructure necessary for a presidential bid for the 2020 re-election. Not only that, the Trump campaign said he would help Republican candidates in the round of elections scheduled for this year.Trump announcing his seriousness to run for the White House again hardly surprised anyone. Even before he had taken oath, he had prepared the paperwork for his re-election even before he took oath in January 2017.However, it remains to be seen if he even manages to get the Republican nomination. The Grand Old Party (GOP) had been unable to stop him from clinching the ticket in 2016. And with many Republican seats in the US Senate and House of Representatives coming up for re-election this year, many candidates are running away from any association with Donald Trump.Trump-backed candidates have faced a string of defeats in elections. Of all the defeats, the one that stung the most was that of Roy Moore to Democrat Doug Jones. The seat was in the deeply Republican Alabama, where it was considered impossible for the Democrats to score a victory.If many more Republican candidates lose in 2018 due to the anti-Trump wave, the chances that the Republican Party may find enough reason to come together to keep Trump away.', 'MUMBAI: Sridevi – the iconic Indian actress and the first female superstar of Bollywood – will be cremated today, four days after she dies in her hotel room in Dubai.The untimely demise of the beloved actress had plunged the entire nation and millions of her fans worldwide in a state of shock and disbelief.

Sridevi passed away after suffering severe cardiac arrest in Dubai.Sridevi’s Pakistani co-actor from the 2017 film ‘Mom’, Adnan Siddiqui was one of the first few people to reach the Jumeirah Emirates Tower after learning about the actress’ demise on Saturday night.

I immediately called up Boney [Kapoor] saab and rushed to him,” adding that, “I got to Jumeirah Emirates at around midnight. Initially, I was not allowed to go upstairs. At the time of the investigation, only Boney saab and Dubai officials were present. So, I waited in the lobby for about an hour.”He further added, “When everything was settled, Boney saab called me upstairs. He was there along with a family friend, his wife and a daughter. Boney saab was crying like a baby; he was inconsolable. I was with him until 5 am. He was under a lot of stress, so I advised him to rest, and then left.”The Pakistani actor, who is a good friends with Sridevi and Kapoor, couldn’t catch up with the actress after their fim’s release due to the ban on Pakistani artistes after Uri attacks. However, Sridevi had personally invited him for her nephew Mohit Marwah’s wedding in Dubai. “When I landed in Dubai at 11 pm last week, I called up Boney saab and asked him if it made sense for me to come at that hour considering the function may have been over. He said, ‘Even if the function gets over, we will wait for you’. So I drove for two hours to Ras Al-Khaimah,” recollected Siddiqui, adding that, Sridevi was true to her word, she indeed was waiting for him. “I can’t believe that I met her four days ago and now, she is no more,” added Siddiqui.The cause of actress’ death on Monday was revealed as ‘accidental drowning’ in a bathtub in her hotel bathroom.The actress’ mortal remains are likely to return to the country on Tuesday after the repatriation formalities are completed.', 'Mumbai: Sridevi reportedly drowned after losing her balance and falling into the bathtub under the influence of alcohol.A forensic report has cited accidental drowning as the cause of death, according to Gulf News, tweeted by news agency ANI. ANI also tweeted the forensic examination found traces of alcohol in the actor’s blood and that she lost her balance under the influence of alcohol, fell into the bathtub and drowned.Her body has also been released for embalming. The case has been handed over to the Dubai Public Prosecution, which will take forward the ‘legal procedures’ in the case.However, the latest update too is that Boney Kapoor has been taken into questioning there since he was the last person to see the body.“There is no benchmark of how much time it could take. He (Boney Kapoor) may be asked for a statement as he was the last person to see her alive, it would not suggest that he is under investigation,” executive editor of Khaleej Times, Vicky Kapur, told Times Now.According to a report on Times Now, the Dubai police have ruled out foul play and disaffirmed any criminal motive behind the death.Dubai police has ruled out any foul play as of now, but the case might be referred to public prosecution as tweeted by Dubai media office, now we have to watch and see what is the latest update on it: Suchitra Chowdhury, Journalist, Dubai  #SrideviDeathMystery— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) February 26, 2018', 'Durban: The pace attacks of South Africa and Australia are preparing to slug it out for supremacy in what is likely to be a bruising four-Test series over the next five weeks.The countries will pin their hopes of victory on their quicks with seamer friendly wickets on order for the Tests in Durban, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Johannesburg, and the contests set to be dominated by fiery exchanges of fast bowling. The series between the world’s second and third-ranked teams starts on Thursday with the first Test at Kingsmead in Durban and both countries brimming with confidence after success in their last respective series.South Africa’s bowlers struck fear into India in their opening two Tests in January before the tourists settled in and won a consolation game in the three-match series.This was achieved without injury-plagued veteran Dale Steyn but Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada proved a potent trio, supplemented by the arrival on the test scene of 21-year-old Lungi Ngidi.He took nine wickets in the last two Tests against India at an average of 17.22 and reached speeds of 150 km/h.Australia produced record-breaking bowling performances as they thumped England 4-0 in the five-Test Ashes series from November to January. Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc took 20 or more wickets each, as did spinner Nathan Lyon.“I think there’s always a couple of series a year the whole cricketing world turns to and it feels like this series is going to be one,” said Cummins after Australia won a three-day warm-up against South Africa A at the weekend.“I feel like we play a similar brand of cricket, both try and be quite aggressive and brave and take the game on. And both teams have some fast bowlers that want to… intimidate the batsmen.”Batting reputations will be tested with Australia captain Steve Smith the primary target for the home bowlers and the hosts looking to exploit some indifferent form of late displayed by talisman AB de Villiers for the South Africans.An injury to his right index finger has kept De Villiers out for the last fortnight, along with captain Faf du Plessis who has a finger injury of his own to add to recent back ailments.But both are in the South Africa squad for the first two Tests and will be the mainstay of the home batting lineup.', 'Wellington: Seth Rance, who is also a station officer with the Greytown Fire Brigade besides being a New Zealand fast bowler, recently took his black cap off to don a fire helmet when a pub’s roof in the town caught fire.Better known for putting heat on his deliveries on-field, Rance helped dousing the flame that threatened to engulf Wairarapa’s landmark pub, The White Swan, in New Zealand. It was learnt that crews from across Wairarapa arrived at the blaze on main station after the fire broke out near a chimney at the back corner of the building.Reflecting on the same, Rance said that it was quite fortunate that they received the call early, adding that there is a little bit of structural and water damage and nothing else.“The origin of the fire was in the southern end of the building. There’s a little bit of structural and water damage but it appears to have been caught in time. It’s fortunate we got the call nice and early,”ESPNcricinfo quoted Rance, as saying.Rance has appeared in two ODIs and four T20I since making his international debut for New Zealand last year.He, however, is not the only New Zealand player who is engaged in a day job in the uniformed services.Earlier, former New Zealand speedster Shane Bond also had a parallel career as a policeman.', 'If Saurashtra skipper Cheteshwar Pujara were to be rated by the plan he had in his mind before the beginning of the chase, he would get 10 out of 10. A plan telling you that he certainly belonged to the elite league, especially the way he had conceptualized it, considering he didn’t have latest hands-on limited-overs experience. However, good planning is nothing if the execution is faulty: the end result will be a failure, no matter how hard one tries in the latter stages to make it a success.On Tuesday, Pujara was to witness his own plan fall apart, phase by phase, over by over, during the 253-run chase in the final of the Vijay Hazare Trophy against Karnataka at the Ferozeshah Kotla in New Delhi.The 30-year-old went according to plan in building a firm base. Tick. Then he sat on the base, slowing down the progress, thus introducing the fault, and later desperately doing his damnedest to repair the damage. Alas, it was already a little too late. Saurashtra fell short by 41 runs. He might have got to a brave 94 of 127 balls but he operated at a snail’s pace (strike rate of nearly 50) during the building phase, copping a lot of criticism by many after the match.Saurashtra stuttered at the start losing two quick wickets (15/2) but Pujara and Avi Barot steadied the ship, adding 62 runs in the following 15 overs. On a wicket that was slow and had crumbled near the business area on either end, a run-rate of 4.5 wasn’t at all bad, considering the odd slower balls by the medium pacers spat from the surface.Stroke-making was a challenge but not quite an impossible task. However, Pujara’s inability to rotate strike frequently during that period had a negative effect on his partner, who in desperation holed out to long-on at a crucial juncture. Barot was better rotating the strike but Pujara had completley dropped anchor.“I thought we had a fair chance the way we had started but middle overs was the phase where we didn’t bat well and lost too many wickets in two-three overs. So that was the reason we lost but 253 I think was really gettable on this wicket,” Pujara said after the match.Not just Pujara, but every eye present in the ground thought likewise. Then came Ravindra Jadeja and began Saurashtra’s blockathon, literally. In the next ten overs, they had compiled just 24 runs, at 2.4 per over, giving Karnataka the upper hand. Though it was getting tough to negotiate the spinners, there was no denying that the set Pujara had failed to show intent.And that is where you see the difference between Pujara the Test player and Pujara the limited batsman in shorter formats. He may still harbour hopes to put his limited-overs career back on track but such innings are proof enough, highlighting his inability to force the pace.Till the time Karnataka spinners K Gowtham, Pavan Deshpande and Shreyas Gopal operated, Pujara did not step out even once forcing them to bowl according to his liking. Somewhere it also shows his reluctance or the under-confidence to jump out to deliveries bowled from a flatter trajectory. In the longest format of the game, however, Pujara has all the time to pick the right delivery before jumping out to place it to perfection.  The consequence was another blow for Saurashtra in the form of Jadeja, who was suffering from a stiff back. Frustration saw him hole out too. Another two wickets followed in quick succession as the newcomers tried to get among the runs straight away on the tricky Kotla wicket. Suddenly from 77/3, Saurashtra were tottering at 101/6 in only the 29th over.  While Pujara might not have felt the pressure of the run-rate mounting and having asked his partners to keep their cool, the pressure of surmounting 253 had certainly trickled down to the less experienced.“We lost too many wickets early on and had we had wickets in hand I would have accelerated after 20-30 overs, but if we are six down, I can’t take that risk and middle overs was the phase where the ball was turning a bit. That was the time I talked to other batsmen that we need to be careful and once you are set on this wicket, you could play your shots,” Pujara claimed.   Pujara appears to be right in his estimation. It was easier to score runs off pace than spin. At the same time, had he shown more intent and rotated strike often, even if it was to score singles and doubles, the situation could have been much better. There was a time during the chase when Pujara actually seemed unfazed by the asking rate, and rather looked to be preparing for his County stint, starting early April.And then came the time when Pujara took the offensive alongside Kamlesh Makwana, showing the spark in the latter stages of the chase. With Saurashtra needing 87 of 48 balls, Pujara made his intentions clear and smacked Sreenath Aravind for 15 runs to reach 84 in 121 balls. That even left Karnataka captain Karun Nair baffled. “He took us by surprise. We didn’t expect him to play those strokes,” he said.Two overs later, when Pujara had raised the hopes of a turnaround with his side needing 62 off 36 balls, he got run out six runs short of a century.The game was over but you could certainly thank him for waking up the visitors from their afternoon nap. But honestly, the onslaught came a little too late and could have arrived a good 10-12 overs before.   “Well, I was batting very well and knew if we needed 100 runs in the last 10 overs, it was quite gettable considering the small boundary and the quick outfield. I was telling Makwana that we should carry on and I will just take the bowlers on, but unfortunately, I got run out. Had I been batting, things could have been different and had we batted well in the middle overs, we wouldn’t have lost by 41 runs,” Pujara said.Pujara stalling in the middle overs wasn’t anything new in this tournament. In fact, all his recent Vijay Hazare outings highlight his weakness to up the run-scoring.In the last game against Andhra, he had scored 17 off 53 balls, and the game previous to that he scored 40 off 66 against Baroda. Interestingly, this is the phase which tells us about his plan falling apart. Pujara is usually set when he reaches the middle-overs and where he should be trying to force himself on the opposition, he exactly does the opposite.In the end, when Pujara shared his clever approach, it showed his shrewdness as a batsman and the hunger to keep going with an aim to see his side through. But often, the best of plans backfire on days when you need them to work the most. You could say, it was one of those days in the life of Pujara.   ', 'Hyderabad: G.

The children were reportedly aged between 8 and 10 years.Baitha, a BJP leader from Sitamarhi district, has since been suspended by the BJP for six years.Baitha’s car had lost control and ploughed through the group of children outside the Dharmpur Government School building in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district. The children were returning from the school when the accident happened.He had gone into hiding after the accident, sparking protests from the opposition RJD on Tuesday. The RJD alleged that Baitha was drunk and driving the car when the accident happened. It had also attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is in power in alliance with the BJP, over Baitha’s alleged drunkenness, since it was the Nitish Kumar government that had imposed prohibition in the state.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had accused the Nitish government of shielding Baitha since he was a member of the BJP.BJP leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi had however rubbished this allegation, saying political affiliation would have nothing to do with how Baitha is treated for his alleged crime. He said he had directed the police to take the sternest possible action against Baitha.The BJP and CM Nitish Kumar also anounced that they would not celebrate Holi to mourn for the children killed in the accident.The accident sparked rage in the area. Local residents had vandalised the school, beat up teachers and set fire to the chairs and benches. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had expressed sorrow and grief over the incident.

He was a Class III student in the government school in his village. He was a resident of the Ammapalli village near Balijipeta, about 150 km north of Visakhapatnam.Jaswant was reportedly going to a farm in his village when the attack happened, news agency ANI reported. It is not clear what caused the dog to attack the boy.Stray dogs have been reported as a menace from different parts of the country in recent years. The issue has been an especially hot-button topic in Kerala. In that state alone, the number of reported cases of people bitten by stray dogs was a whopping 53,000. In May last year, a 50-year-old fisherman succumbed to his injuries after being mauled by a pack of stray dogs in Trivandrum’s Pulluvila. Prior to that, a 75-year-old man was found dead after being allegedly attacked by a pack of stray dogs in Kerala’s Attingal.Before that, stray dogs were seen as a massive problem in Bengaluru, where a child was killed by a pack of dogs.More recently, stary dogs have been reported as a menace in as wide-ranging laces as Delhi, Noida and Odisha’s Bhubaneswar. They have also been reported to have become an issue in Punjab’s Nabha, Karnataka’s Mysuru, Pune in Maharashtra and Ladakh in Jammu & Kashmir.The most common response of local administrations has been mass culling campaigns, that are usually met with outrage from animal rights activists.

He appears to have been arrested as soon as he landed in Chennai. He had been on a visit to the United Kingdom, specifically his alma mater at Cambridge University.This case relates to the approval given by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for receipt of funds to INX Media, which had happened while his father P Chidambaram was Union Finance Minister.The central probe had registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), the ED’s equivalent of a police FIR, against the accused named in a CBI complaint, including Karti Chidambaram, INX Media and its directors — Peter and Indrani Mukerjea.The ECIR was lodged under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).It was the Enforcement Directorate which had provided information about the alleged illegal payments made by INX Media, based on which the CBI had filed its FIR.The CBI had also carried out searches at the houses and offices of Karti Chidambaram across four cities for allegedly receiving money from the media firm owned by the Mukerjeas to scuttle a tax probe.The Chidambarams, however, have denied all the charges made against them.The CBI had filed the FIR against Karti and the Mukerjeas on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, receiving illegal gratification, influencing public servants and criminal misconduct.The agency has alleged that Karti received money from INX Media for using his influence to manipulate a tax probe against it in a case of violation of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) conditions to receive investment from Mauritius.The CBI FIR was made out against Karti, his company Chess Management Services, the Mukerjeas (currently in jail on charges of murder of their daughter Sheena Bora), INX Media, Advantage Strategic Consulting Services and its director Padma Vishwanathan.', 'Leipzig (Germany): A top German court today ruled that cities can impose diesel driving bans to combat air pollution, a landmark decision that plunges millions of drivers into uncertainty.The Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig found that local authorities can legally ban older, dirty diesel from certain zones as part of their efforts to improve air quality — a drastic move that could reshape inner-city travel and upend the auto industry.The court did not impose any bans itself, leaving that up t the city and municipal authorities. The judges did, however, urge them to “exercise proportionality” and said any curbs should be introduced gradually and allow for certain exemptions.While the legal battle centred around the smog-clogged cities of Stuttgart and Duesseldorf, it could have nationwide repercussions.The ruling is a major blow to the government and the nation’s mighty automakers who are strongly opposed to driving bans, fearing outrage from diesel owners whose lives stand to be disrupted and whose vehicles could plummet in value.Eager to reassure anxious car owners, the government insisted that nothing would change right away and stressed that bans were not inevitable.“The court has not issued any driving bans but created clarity about the law,” said Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks. “Driving bans can be avoided, and my goal is and will remain that they do not come into force,” she added.Chancelor Angela Merkel also weighed in, saying the ruling concerned only “individual cities”. “It’s really not about the entire country and all car owners,” she said.But the outcome marks a huge victory for the environmentalist group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), which sued Stuttgart and Duesseldorf to force them to take action against the toxic nitrogen oxides and fine particles emitted by older diesel engines.Lower-level judges had already backed their demand for driving bans, but the states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia appealed the rulings, saying such curbs should be decided at the federal level.But judges at the nation’s top administrative court again sided with the environmental campaigners. “It’s a great day for clean air in Germany,” said DUH chief Juergen Resch.In a nod to concerns about the affected cars’ resale values, judge Andreas Korbmacher said “certain losses will have to be accepted”. He also urged city and municipal authorities to avoid “a patchwork” of local measures.Critics had earlier argued that any bans would be complicated to enforce and cause confusion among drivers.Analysts at EY consultancy said drivers of all but the latest diesel models that adhere to the strictest Euro 6 standards “can no longer be certain of being allowed to drive at any time, 365 days a week”. It estimates that some 10 million vehicles will be affected across the country.Ahead of the closely-watched court decision, the German transport ministry signalled it was already preparing for possible bans, floating plans to update traffic regulations to include the option of city-ordered diesel exclusions.Concerns over the harmful effects of diesel have soared since Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to installing cheating devices in millions of cars that allowed them to secretly spew far more nitrogen oxide than legally allowed.The poisonous gases have been linked to respiratory illnesses and heart problems, and are responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year. ', 'Pyongyang: North Korea told a United Nations disarmament forum on Tuesday that sanctions over its nuclear programme would “never work”, as it voiced further defiance against President Donald Trump`s “maximum pressure” campaign. The “US should (be) aware that sanctions and pressure will never threaten (North Korea) and never work”, said Han Tae Song, Pyongyang`s envoy to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The comments came days after Trump unveiled what he described as the “heaviest sanctions ever” levied on North Korea.That may be an overstatement given past tough measures against Pyongyang approved by Washington, but Trump`s administration has confirmed that the new sanctions target virtually every ship North Korea is currently using. North Korean diplomats repeatedly spar with US officials at the disarmament body in Geneva, a venue where the bitter rivals argue face-to-face.“If the US ignores our sincere efforts for improving inter-Korean relations… but prefers provocation and confrontation, the DPRK will certainly respond,” Han said, using an acronym for the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. Despite an apparent easing of tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang at the just concluded “peace Olympics” in the South`s city of Pyeongchang, Trump has pledged to maintain pressure on the North. He has warned that if the latest sanctions do not work, “we`ll have to go to phase two. Phase two may be a very rough thing.” Washington`s disarmament ambassador on Tuesday repeated his insistence that the United States would never accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. “It will not happen,” Robert Wood said, replying to Han`s threats.', 'San Francisco: While Google`s rise has helped its parent company Alphabet break all revenue records, Google`s Indian-born CEO Sundar Pichai neither receives any financial information about Alphabet`s “Other Bets” nor has any decision-making power over them.In newly-released government documents to the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and reported by CNBC late Monday, Alphabet has published details about the structure of its overall businesses.“Pichai also does not have authority over Alphabet`s overall resource allocation to Google,” the report said, quoting from the Alphabet`s letter to SEC.However, when it comes to Google, Pichai receives weekly and quarterly reports which include individual financial information for Google product areas.These reports include YouTube, advertising and hardware and operating results, capital expenditures and headcount for Google.“Neither Alphabet CEO Larry Page nor his co-founder, Alphabet President Sergey Brin, receive the weekly and quarterly reports received by Pichai,” the SEC document said.Without Page`s approval, Pichai can commit Google to non-standard licensing or similar arrangements, investments, mergers and acquisitions.“Although Susan Wojcicki and Diane Greene both have “CEO” titles within Google, for YouTube and Cloud respectively, Pichai is the only Google executive who reports directly to and maintains regular contact with Page,” said the report.The Alphabet CEO receives regular financial information about every Alphabet company but doesn`t allocate resources to individual product areas within Google or within individual “Other Bets”.“Other Bets” holds 11 different companies, which includes self-driving car unit Waymo and healthcare arm Verily.“Page proposes compensation for Google CEO Pichai and all aOther Beta¿ CEOs, but no other executives below that,” the report added.', 'New Delhi: In order to clear the extra rush of passengers, the Indian Railways has decided to run 500 special trains during Holi.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau proposed legislating pay equity, and offering parental leave to fathers “to make it easier for women to return to work sooner, if they so choose.”This is in addition to CAD 7.5 billion (USD 5.9 billion) previously earmarked to create 40,000 new daycare spaces over the next three years.“For the first time in our history, there are now more Canadians aged 65 and older than there are people under the age of 15,” Morneau said in a speech to parliament.“Who will step in to fill the gap left as more and more seniors leave the workforce? We believe that Canada’s future rests on making sure that every Canadian has an opportunity to work, and to earn a good living from that work.“And that includes Canada’s talented, ambitious, and hard-working women.”The gender gap in Canada’s labour market has already seen a dramatic shift in the last 40 years. In 2017, nearly 83 percent of women aged 25 to 54 were working, up from less than 54 percent in 1977, according to the government statistical agency.But women on average still earn just 69 cents for every dollar earned by men, a situation Morneau’s initiatives seek to change.Otherwise the budget offers a mere CAD 7.6 billion in new program spending, and put off new major initiatives — such as national pharmacare — until the next election cycle in 2019.Canada’s economy surged after Liberals took office in 2015 and unleashed a massive fiscal stimulus. But growth is now forecast to slow from 3.0 percent in 2017 to 2.2 percent in 2018, and 1.6 percent in 2019.Under the government’s plan, the fiscal deficit would fall to CAD18.1 billion, or 0.8 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product.The budget includes CAD 323.4 billion in revenues and CAD 338.5 in program spending and public debt charges.The federal debt is forecast to rise to CAD 669.6 billion (or 30.1 per cent of the economy) and keep going up, with no end in sight.', 'The Congress party on Wednesday suspended four of its members of Legislative Council, including former state party chief Ashok Chaudhary, in Bihar.

Relax, a little anxiety may help you in remembering things, researchers have claimed.The study, published in the journal Journal Brain Sciences, showed that manageable levels of anxiety actually aided people in being able to recall the details of events.Conversely, when anxiety levels got too high or descended into fear, it led to the colouring of memories where people begin to associate otherwise neutral elements of an experience to the negative context, the researchers noted.“People with high anxiety have to be careful,” said Myra Fernandes, Professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada.“To some degree, there is an optimal level of anxiety that is going to benefit your memory, but we know from other researches that high levels of anxiety can cause people to reach a tipping point, which impacts their memories and performance,” Fernandes added.For the study, the researchers assessed 80 undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo, including 64 females.Half of the participants were randomly assigned to a deep encoding instruction group while the other half were randomly assigned to a shallow encoding group.The results showed that individuals with high anxiety levels showed a heightened sensitivity to the influences of emotional context on their memory, with neutral information becoming tainted, or coloured by the emotion with which it was associated during encoding.“By thinking about emotional events or by thinking about negative events this might put you in a negative mindset that can bias you or change the way you perceive your current environment,” explained Christopher Lee, researcher at the varsity.', 'New Delhi: Fans haven’t been able to come to terms with the passing away of the legendary actress Sridevi, who left for her heavenly abode on late Saturday evening in Dubai’s Jumeirah Emirates Towers.

When I started playing for India that is when I thought someday I have to be (on) top of the world.“I am trying to be World No.1…Now my dream is to become World No. 1 and definitely it’s in progress. I would want to see myself there,” the Rio Olympics silver medallist said.Participating in an interaction with students and teachers during a promotional event organised at her alma mater Auxilium High School here, Sindhu said her mother has been her inspiration.“She has always been there saying that ‘do your best’ and ‘give your best’ in whatever you do. Be brave and stay strong and all women should do that and believe in ourselves,” Sindhu said on her mother.Asked on the challenges she faced to attain success, Sindhu said she faced many challenges.“But I don’t feel it’s a burden kind of thing because I wanted to achieve my dream and I just followed that.” “There was a certain time where I thought what’s going on wrong because at sometimes you might not give your best.Sometimes you might just play brilliantly but when you tend to lose, you think that what’s happening or what’s going on wrong.“I think learning from your mistakes and coming back much more stronger is important thing that is what I feel and that’s how I learnt and came up in my life,” Sindhu said.Reacting to another query, Sindhu said, “You have to always be grounded, that is most important thing.

Hasan, who was playing for the Karachi Kings, was one of six players charged with various breaches of the Pakistan Cricket Board’s anti-corruption code during the second edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) held in the United Arab Emirates.“Hasan has been banned for one year and fined one million rupees on one charge and we have requested for more action against him on inducing other players for fixing,” board legal adviser Taffazul Rizvi told the media.Hasan, an aggressive opener, played three one-day internationals and 10 Twenty20 internationals before losing his place due to poor performance in 2010.The PSL was rocked by scandal in February last year when it was announced that several players were caught in a spot-fixing incident. Spot-fixing involves determining the outcome of a specific part of a match rather than the overall result, and is therefore harder to detect than match-fixing.The PCB formed a three-man tribunal which later banned Sharjeel Khan for five years (two and a half suspended) while Khalid Latif was banned for five full years and fined one million rupees.Mohammad Irfan was banned for one year (six months suspended), Mohammad Nawaz for two months (one suspended) and Nasir Jamshed for one year. The third edition of the PSL is currently being staged in the UAE, with two play-offs in Lahore and the final in Karachi on March 25.The PCB took extra measures to stem spot-fixing, with all six teams in this year’s league monitored by anti-corruption officers. Pakistan has a history of fixing, with former captain Salim Malik and Ataur Rehman banned for life in 2000.A spot-fixing case during Pakistan’s tour of England in 2010 ended in five-year bans on then Test captain Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir.Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria is also serving a life ban on charges of spot-fixing during a county match in England in 2009.', 'Berlin: Louis van Gaal has ruled out returning to Bayern Munich and succeeding Jupp Heynckes — as long as Uli Hoeness remains club president.Bayern are 19 points clear in the Bundesliga table and in the hunt for the treble of European, German league and cup titles. However, Bayern’s current head coach Heynckes, 72, has repeatedly said he will quit at the end of the season. The search is on to replace him and Van Gaal, currently without a club, would be an obvious candidate.The 66-year-old has won 20 club titles in his career, most recently the 2016 FA Cup in a two-year stint at Manchester United.He coached Bayern from 2009-11, losing the 2010 Champions League final, but winning the Bundesliga and German Cup titles only to be sacked the following season.The Dutchman says he “loves” Bayern, but ruled out returning.“I have always gone back, whether it was to Barcelona, the national Dutch team, AZ Alkmaar, but returning to Bayern? – I can’t imagine that,” Van Gaal told magazine Sport Bild.“As long as Uli Hoeness is at the club, I won’t work there.”Van Gaal was dismissed in April 2011 when Bayern slipped out of the German league’s top three —  the Champions League places at the time.The Dutchman lifted the lid on working under Hoeness.“Uli Hoeness has cultivated special relationships with certain players and campaigns for their interests,” Van Gaal explained.“Like (Franck) Ribery, who according to Mr Hoeness, should always play. In my opinion, that’s not good for the work of a coach. The team is important and not the individual players – in this regard Hoeness and I differ. After one conversation (with Hoeness) my wife told me I should quit FC Bayern. I kept working there because I love the club.Never give up“The German mentality is also my mentality.“Hard training, fight until the end, never give up – the job was made for me.”Van Gaal says Hoeness would criticise him for blooding current stars, like Thomas Mueller and David Alaba who were inexperienced at the time.“I would always select Thomas Mueller (early in his career) and Hoeness would tell my wife in the VIP lounge ‘your husband has picked the wrong team again!’,” said Van Gaal.“Same with David Alaba. He made a mistake in the last minute of a game which led to my dismissal. Now he is one of the biggest talents Bayern has.”The Dutch disciplinarian confirmed two legends from his turbulent times at Bayern. He admits once pulling striker Luca Toni by the ear for slouching during a meal – “it was disrespectful to his team-mates and me”.He also hints that he pulled down his underwear in the dressing room, after defeat at Mainz, to show his stars he “had the balls” to drop them.“What happened with my players behind closed doors should remain so, but anyone who knows me also knows it could have happened. I am emotional,” said Van Gaal.Despite his personality clash with Hoeness, Van Gaal talked of his affection for Bayern.“Manchester United, the last team I coached, are a commercial club, Bayern are totally different,” he said.“The bosses, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness, are former players who know what they are talking about. For them, football is the most important thing, not money, like it is at United. That’s why I love FC Bayern.”', 'New Delhi: Indian ace shuttler HS Prannoy is not happy with the Badminton World Federations (BWF) proposal to tweak the scoring system and reduce on-court coaching, saying such changes will not achieve the aim of increasing commercial value of the sport.The BWF Council has proposed that on-court coaching, which is allowed at the 11-point lemon break and at the end of every game in a match, be reduced. The proposal also suggests “reduce time being taken between points” and “reduce warm-up time” and “racket testing” — all aimed at increasing the commercial value of the sport and enhance the quality of its broadcast product. The plan will require endorsement at the BWF’s Annual General Meeting in Bangkok in May to be implemented in international badminton. World No. 11 Prannoy said:“Badminton is an extremely fast sport and if you don’t have enough break, you have hardly time to breath, you cant swipe sweat, you cant go out or have water, I mean all the rules are against the players. There are days when things don’t fall into place, so you need your coach on those days by your side because they know you best,” he said.The world body’s panel has also called for a best-of-five format instead of the current three-game structure. It has also been suggested that games be of 11 points each instead of the current 21-point format. Prannoy felt the proposed changes could give an advantage to players who are unfit.“Im not really supportive of this format, because I don’t find 21 point to be boring. Probably, it would be an advantage for them who are not physically fit. I think in coming years we will find many players who were not been in the top 30 suddenly be in the top 30. Im not really happy with the rule change,” he said.The BWF Council’s reason of proposing the changes is to optimise the presentation of badminton at the highest level, increase the commercial value of the sport and enhance the quality of its broadcast product.“I dont understand how tennis is spectator friendly when match goes on for five hours, where everything is slow. Whereas a badminton match is hardly 90 minutes and even then if people are not able to push through then I would say it is because the sport is not popular and it is not about the format or game,” Prannoy said.“If TV can telecast a five hour tennis match why cant they show one quarterfinal day (in badminton) where the entire proceedings would be five hours. So I dont think changing format, whether you make it 11-point or 15-point, would make any difference.” Prannoy has been missing in action this season after he developed warts on his feet.He went for a treatment on February 1 and recently started training again to compete at the All England Championship to be held from March 14 to 18.“I removed them (warts) through a procedure on Feb 1. I went home and had some time off. I started training two weeks back and started playing this week. The All England Championships looks a little dicey for me as you need to be 100 per cent fit. All the top players are playing, the draw looks tough and so are the conditions. So no plans, I hardly have two more weeks to go for All England, so I am just look to go there and enjoy.“I am really looking to play well at the CWG. I will have three weeks after the All England and I should be 100 per cent fit for CWG. On the positive side, I will be fresh and All England would be a good match practice. I am really hungry to play games,” said the 25-year-old.Prannoy also credited coach Pullela Gopichand and Kidambi Srikanth for setting the bar high for him and others. “The bar that Srikanth has set after he won four Super Series Tour titles last year has really changed the mindset of the players. That has brought a good difference in our training sessions,” he said.He also praised Sameer Verma and P Kashyap for battling injuries and coming back with a win at Swiss Open and Austrain Open. “I have learnt from Sameer the power of positivity. He is never negative despite suffering so many injuries. Same goes for Kashyap, who is one of the most experienced in the team,” said Prannoy, who himself has been troubled by a string of injuries in the past.', 'London: Google has received more than 2.4 million requests to remove URLs from its Search under Europe’s “Right to be Forgotten” laws since they were introduced in May 2014.In a landmark ruling, the European Court of Justice established the “right to be forgotten,” or more accurately, the “right to delist”, allowing Europeans to ask search engines to delist information about themselves from search results.“Since 2014, we’ve provided information about “right to be forgotten” delisting requests in our Transparency Report, including the number of URLs submitted to us, the number of URLs delisted and not delisted, and anonymised examples of some of the requests we have received,” Michee Smith, Product Lead, Google Transparency Report, said in a blog post.In deciding what to delist, search engines like Google must consider if the information in question is “inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive” — and whether there is a public interest in the information remaining available in search results.“We’re expanding the scope of our transparency reporting about the “right to be forgotten” and adding new data going back to January 2016 when our reviewers started manually annotating each URL submitted to us with additional information,” Smith added.About a third of the removal requests were related to social media and directory services, while around 21 per cent were URLs related to news outlets and government websites that mostly covered someone’s legal history, The Verge reported on Wednesday.According to Google, it shows a breakdown of the requests made by private individuals vs. non-private individuals — like government officials or corporate entities.“We classify the content that the individual has asked us to delist into a set of categories: personal information, professional information, crime, and name not found, meaning that we were not able to find the individual’s name on the page,” Smith further said.“When we evaluate a URL for potential delisting, we classify the website that hosts the page as a directory site, news site, social media, or other,” he added.Google has also released draft of a new research paper called “Three Years of the Right to be Forgotten” which has been submitted for peer review.', 'A Delhi-based woman has alleged mishandling by a doctor inside an operation theatre at a hospital in the national capital. The woman has claimed that after she got admitted to a hospital in October, she was taken for a surgery that wasn’t supposed to be done.The woman alleged that she was given anaesthesia and suspects that the doctor might have “done something” to her. “I got admitted in October for a surgery which wasn’t supposed to be done. In operation theatre I was given anaesthesia and doctor might have done something to me,” she said.“I’ve gone through surgery, I know how anaesthesia works and when people do something,” the woman added.According to her, she has been unable to even sit or stand properly since the surgery took place. She is also compelled to take painkillers every day.“My health is completely up and down now,” she said, adding that an FIR had been lodged against the doctor. She even alleged that after the surgery, the doctor showed her a piece of flesh that he had allegedly taken out of her body during surgery.“I have lodged FIR against him for everything he did to me. Piece of flesh was taken out of my body and he showed it to me,” she said.The identity of the woman or the doctor has not been revealed yet.

The freeze was expected to continue for much of the week.In southern Romania, an 83-year-old woman from Adancata was found collapsed in the snow and died on the way to hospital, the Institute for Emergency Situations (ISU) said. A 65-year-old man was found dead late on Monday in the eastern county of Suceava, an official told state news agency Agerpres.(Photo: AFP)Parts of a motorway linking the capital Bucharest to Constanta and dozens of other roads were closed. More than 80 trains and 15 flights were cancelled, Romanian police said, and Romania’s Black Sea ports were closed.Record snowfall of 182 cm (72 inches) paralysed the northern Croatian town of Delnice and rescue services took several hours to evacuate residents in the nearby village of Mrzle Vodice. Temperatures hit a low of -20 degrees Celsius in Zavizan on the Velebit mountain.Schools were closed in Bucharest and ten Romanian counties as well as across western and central Croatia.The roofs of dozens of houses collapsed under the weight of snow in the Unsko-Sanski canton in northwestern Bosnia.State-run RTCG TV reported that Montenegro’s main Golubovci airport was closed for several hours overnight.A rare snowstorm in Rome on Monday prompted Italian authorities to call in the army to help clear the streets.', 'Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday reserved its order on 20 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs’ plea challenging their disqualification in office-of-profit case.A bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar kept its decision pending after the MLAs, Election Commission of India (EC) and other parties concerned concluded their arguments.The MLAs had on Tuesday told the court that EC’s order disqualifying them for allegedly holding office-of-profit was passed in “complete violation of natural justice” as they were not given the opportunity to explain their stand before the poll panel.The bench was also requested by the legislators to remand their case back to the poll panel with a direction to hear the matter afresh.The MLAs had approached the HC challenging their disqualification after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his nod to the EC’s recommendation.Backing its recommendation to the President for AAP MLAs’ disqualification, the poll panel had submitted that the legislators cannot claim that they were not holding office-of-profit.The EC had earlier claimed that the disqualified MLAs’ plea was not maintainable and was liable to be dismissed.The HC was hearing the plea on a day-to-day basis since February 7, 2018.Earlier, on January 24, 2018, the Delhi High Court had refused to stay the Centre’s notification disqualifying 20 AAP MLAs for holding office of profit.The HC had summoned the entire records pertaining to the proceedings leading to the recommendation of the EC for 20 MLAs’ disqualification which received the President’s assent on January 20, 2018.On January 19, 2018, the poll panel had made the recommendation for the disqualification of the 20 legislators, which was given assent by the President.On January 20, 2018, the Ministry of Law and Justice issued a notification that the President had held that the 20 MLAs stand disqualified under Section 15(1)(a) of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act.The EC had made the recommendation while deciding a plea by advocate Prashant Patel, seeking disqualification of 21 AAP MLAs for holding the office of parliamentary secretaries, which he had said amounted to office of profit.Proceedings against Jarnail Singh were dropped after he resigned as the Rajouri Garden MLA to contest the Punjab Assembly polls.The MLAs, whose appointment to the post of Parliamentary Secretaries between March 13, 2015, and September 8, 2016, was held as office of profit, contended that the entire episode leading to their disqualification was a clear manifestation of the process in which they were denied the principle of natural justice of being heard.On January 22, 2018, the MLAs had withdrawn from the HC their earlier applications as they became infructuous on account of President giving his assent to the EC’s recommendation to disqualify them. They had said that the decision by the President as well as the EC was taken in “undue haste”.The 20 MLAs include Adarsh Shastri (Dwarka), Alka Lamba (Chandni Chowk), Anil Bajpai (Gandhi Nagar), Avtar Singh (Kalkaji), Kailash Gahlot (Najafgarh) – who is also a minister – Madan Lal (Kasturba Nagar), Manoj Kumar (Kondli), Naresh Yadav (Mehrauli), Nitin Tyagi (Laxmi Nagar), Praveen Kumar (Jangpura).The others are Rajesh Gupta (Wazirpur), Rajesh Rishi (Janakpuri), Sanjeev Jha (Burari), Sarita Singh (Rohtas Nagar), Som Dutt (Sadar Bazar), Sharad Kumar (Narela), Shiv Charan Goel (Moti Nagar), Sukhbir Singh (Mundka), Vijendar Garg (Rajinder Nagar) and Jarnail Singh (Tilak Nagar).', 'Fort Lauderdale: A Florida court cancelled a hearing scheduled for Tuesday for the 19-year-old man accused of carrying out the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in US history after a deal between prosecutors and defence attorneys, the suspect’s lawyer said.Prosecutors had been scheduled to seek hair and DNA samples from Nikolas Cruz, who faces 17 murder counts for the February 14 rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb of Fort Lauderdale.Broward County prosecutors and Cruz’s publicly appointed defender, Gordon Weekes, reached a deal late Monday to provide those samples, making the hearing unnecessary, Weekes said.“There was no reason to push back,” Weekes said. “It was a routine motion that the state attorney had filed. We submitted an agreed order and there was no need for a court to hear the motion.”The hearing would have been the second courtroom appearance for Cruz since the shooting.The massacre, carried out with a legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle, inflamed the long-running US debate on gun rights, which are addressed in the Second Amendment of the US Constitution.Cruz’s case is due to return to court on Wednesday when a hearing will determine whether he has sufficient assets to pay for his own defence, Weekes said.The shooting has rattled long-drawn political lines on gun rights in the United States, where Republican officials have often opposed efforts by gun control advocates to tighten gun ownership laws, partly out of concern about retribution by the powerful National Rifle Association.US President Donald Trump, a Republican who backed gun rights during and since his 2016 presidential campaign, has been under pressure to show he is responding without alienating Republicans who oppose firearms restrictions.On Monday, he met with 35 governors, urging them to disregard pressure from the NRA as they seek to address firearms safety and school security.Trump has embraced the call to safeguard schools by arming teachers but also has voiced support for strengthening background checks for prospective gun buyers – a proposal the NRA has traditionally resisted.', 'Washington: The US have begun to see “positive indicators” from Pakistan for some time now, a top general said Wednesday, while clarifying that the freeze in American security aid to the country will continue as it is yet to take any decisive action against the Taliban and the Haqqani network.“That’s the current posture. And I would imagine, hopefully, in the future, well have an opportunity to (review),” General Joseph Votel, Commander of the US Central Command, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee when asked about the future of freeze of American security assistance to Pakistan. “So, we remain in a posture of discontinuing that support (to Pakistan),” inquired Indiana Senator Jim Banks.Votel said the US has started to see an increase in communication, information sharing and actions on the ground in response to specific US requests.“These are positive indicators,” he said, adding that “however, ongoing national counter-terrorism efforts against anti-Pakistan militants throughout the country have not yet translated into the definitive actions we require Pakistan to take against Afghan Taliban or Haqqani leaders,”“This problem is compounded by increasing cross-border terrorist attacks and fires between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which hinders both countries abilities to coordinate on border security,” Votel said.The US, he said, has preserved its valuable military-to-military relationship with Pakistan and attempted to increase transparency and communication with influential military leaders, while pressing its serious concerns about the country’s provision of sanctuary and support to militant and terrorist groups that target the US personnel and interests.“Achieving long-term stability in Afghanistan and defeating the insurgency will be difficult without Pakistan’s support and assistance,” he said.Although most security assistance for Pakistan is currently suspended, since 2002 Pakistan has been among the largest recipients of US provided Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET), the general said.He said to date Pakistan has also been reimbursed hundreds of millions of dollars in Coalition Support Funds (CSF) for counter-insurgency operations that support US security objectives in the region.The US uses ground and air routes in Pakistan to deliver materiel to Afghanistan, he said, adding that “we also have options to utilize routes through the other Central Asian nations.”Responding to a question from Senator Banks, Votel said the pressure that the Trump Administration has put on Pakistan has contributed to the recent seen positive response from Islamabad.“I think what is also working right now is the approach that we have in place with them. I think we have tried to be very clear in terms of the things that we Pakistan to do for us. And what I have endeavoured to do — not always in a public way, but in a private way — is develop a relationship that allows us to provide feedback both ways,” he said.There are things, frankly, that Pakistan has asked from the US as well, he said. “So this is a two-way street here. It is my responsibility to make sure that we have feedback loops in place that go back and forth between the things that were doing to try support each other and moving forward in that regard,” Volte said.He said it was important to recognise that Pakistan as a country has suffered greatly from terrorism, “perhaps as much as anybody in the region, or maybe as anybody around the world”.“They have taken a number of measures to address terrorism within their borders,” the general said.“That has contributed, over the years, to some increased security in the area. And we have to recognise at up front. So our approach is to continue to be engaged with them. We want to have a candid discussion. We want to have frequent communication. We want to build trust in this relationship,” Votel said.', 'Bengaluru: A Bengaluru court on Friday rejected the bail plea of Mohammad Harris Nalapad, son of Karnataka Congress MLA NA Haris and six others.Nalapad and the others are in judicial custody since February 21 for assaulting a man in a restaurant on February 17, 2018.“Court expressed that there are going to be chances of witnesses getting influenced and the investigation getting coerced. It is a victory for justice and society at large,” said the public prosecutor, as per ANI.Earlier on February 21, the court had sent Nalapad and others, who confessed to thrashing and threatening a man at a pub in UB City on February 19 and were arrested the next day, to judicial custody till March 7.As per the sequence of events, the victim was having dinner at a restaurant in UB City when Nalapad and his friends walked in at 11:30 pm. The group reportedly told the victim, who had a plaster on one of his legs, to “sit properly”.After a heated exchange of words, Nalapad and his friends attacked the man. The victim was then rushed to the nearby Mallya Hospital for treatment, but the group reportedly followed him there and threatened him. Nalapad, who was serving as the general secretary of Bengaluru city youth Congress, was expelled from the party for six years. He was appointed the general secretary after he emerged victorious in an election held by the Congress for the post in May 2017. He was also the executive director of the Nalapad Group of Companies.On the other hand, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had said at that time, “Offenders should be punished to the full extent of law regardless of who they are. No less, no more. Police will take action as per law and bring the guilty to book.” ', 'As he set to cement his power by removing the two-term limit, Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to appoint four Vice Premiers to work on popular programmes like poverty relief, environmental protection and improving economy which would enhance his image at home. Speculation about the appointment of four Vice Premiers came as China on Friday commenced its well-choreographed annual parliament which was expected to endorse the ruling the Communist Party of China (CPC) proposal to amend the Constitution removing the two-term rule for President and Vice President. China now has two Vice Premiers.Currently, the Chinese constitution, which has been in effect since 1982, prohibits more than two terms for the president and the vice-president. Since 1992, the president has also held the position of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. The removal of term limits, an issue which was taken up during the third plenary of the 19th Congress, is likely to be given approval by the rubber-stamp Congress on 5 March.The proposal sparked off speculation that Xi, who is on course to become modern “China’s Emperor”, wielding unquestionable power exercised by the party founder, Mao Zedong in the heydays of revolution is working on populist agenda which would contribute to his public image. This is probably an acceptance of the long-held belief that the US under Donald Trump is losing its global prominence to China.In the course of next two weeks the China Peoples Political Consultative Conference, (CPPCC) an advisory body and the National Peoples Congress, (NPC) would meet to clear a broad agenda.The CPPCC spokesperson Wang Guoqing kicked off the political season on Friday with a nationally televised press conference in which he took selected questions mostly from the Chinese official media on issues like poverty alleviation, US plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium etc.Conspicuous by their absence were any questions on the removal of the two-term limit for President and Vice President which made headlines at home and abroad.The NPC often referred as rubber stand Parliament for its routine endorsement of the CPC proposals is set to meet from March 5 with the presentation of work report by Premier Li Keqiang.During the next two weeks, various Ministers including Foreign Minister Wang Yi would address the media. The season will end with the press conference by Li.This may be the last tenure for several Ministers as the CPC has already finalised a new set of Ministers and officials as they have completed five-year terms. There will be a complete makeover of the government.The seven-member all-powerful Standing Committee of the CPC, which rules the country is also set for a change as barring Xi and Li the rest have retired. A new Standing Committee had been elected last by the once-in-a-five-year Congress of the CPC.Hong Kong-based the ‘South China Morning Post’ has reported that Xi has identified four CPC officials — Hu Chunhua, Han Zheng, Liu He and He Lifeng, for the post of vice premiers who are likely to be put in charge of the Chinese President’s top three priorities of poverty relief, environmental protection, the control of economic risks.', 'Sridevi has left us at only 54. She was at her prime, both as a woman and an actor. Her performance in Mom last year proved her steely will to excel, no matter the age.Sridevi was determined to take forward her diva image into the coming years. In an earlier interview, she had even strongly protested against the word ‘fifty’. “Don’t even talk about it. I don’t think of my age. Neither should you,” she had admonished.But someone was counting her years. Bollywood screen divas have a nasty habit of leaving us prematurely. Nutan, whom cancer claimed, was only 55 when she left us. Coincidentally, she too died in February like Sridevi. Nutan’s legacy was far greater than Sridevi or any of the other screen legends.Sadly, most of Sridevi’s Hindi films did not match up to her volcanic talent. Judaai and Chandni were at best, mediocre films, although they are much remembered.Throughout the 1980s, she excelled in the most atrocious potboilers from the South directed by the likes of K. Raghavendra Rao.When asked how she managed to be so brilliant even in such awful films, she replied with a giggle, “I never discriminate among my roles. To me, every film is equally precious and I give the same respect to all my directors.”Meena Kumari passed away at the age of 39, just a week before the release of Pakeezah. However, her legendary reputation depends on just a few classics, with most of her work being unquestionably mediocre. Madhubala left us when she was 36. Her celluloid legacy boasts of sporadic brilliance in films like Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, Tarana and the underrated Amar, but it is her swan song Mughal-e-Azam that can still make us swoon.Similarly, Geeta Bali, who shared the impish charm, comic spontaneity and sheer joie de vivre of Sridevi, went suddenly at 35 after an attack of small-pox. Sadly, none of her films have any recall value, not even Albela, which is best remembered for the song Shola jo bhadke.Luckily, Sridevi is a screen great whose performances in Mr India, Chaalbaaz, Sadma, Judaai, Chandni , Lamhe and English Vinglish will keep us regaled till kingdom come. The closest we came to a fitting farewell for Sridevi is English Vinglish, a deeply relevant and engaging discourse on the importance that the Indian middle class attaches to speaking the English language fluently.', 'Los Angeles: Elderly people with a certain type of hearing loss may be more likely to also have memory loss and thinking problems called mild cognitive impairment, says a study.The study, presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 70th Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, looked at people with peripheral age-related hearing loss, which is caused by problems in how the inner ear and hearing nerves function and leads to people not being able to hear. It also looked at central age-related hearing loss, which is caused by problems in the brain’s ability to process sound and leads people to say, “I can hear, but I can’t understand.”The researchers found that people with central hearing loss were twice as likely to have mild cognitive impairment as people who had no hearing loss. “These preliminary results suggest that central hearing loss may share the same progressive loss of functioning in brain cells that occurs in cognitive decline, rather than the sensory deprivation that happens with peripheral hearing loss,” said study author Rodolfo Sardone from the University of Bari in Italy. “It’s a problem with perception. Tests of hearing perception should be given to people who are older than 65 and also to people with cognitive impairment,” Sardone added.Hearing loss is one of the most common disabilities in elderly people, affecting about one-third of people over age 65.The study involved 1,604 participants of the Great Age Study, a population-based study conducted in the south of Italy, with an average age of 75, whose hearing and thinking and memory skills were tested. Of the participants, 26 per cent had peripheral hearing loss and 12 per cent had central hearing loss, 33 per cent were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.Of the 192 people with central hearing loss, 144 people, or 75 per cent, had mild cognitive impairment. In contrast, people with peripheral hearing loss were no more likely to have mild cognitive impairment than people with no hearing problems.The researchers also found that people who had lower scores on a test that measured how well they understood speech also had lower scores on a test of thinking and memory skills.', 'Actress Bellamy Young has released an apology to Ryan Seacrest, after she said that he should not host the upcoming Oscars pre-show amid sexual abuse allegations made against him.Seacrest, who is a longtime host of E! Live from the Red Carpet was acquitted of the claims against him, but his accuser just came forward with detailed accusations against Seacrest. Young was put on spot by Variety magazine, the outlet that had first published the allegations. The interviewer had asked her if Ryan should step aside from the post, but Young knew nothing of the story. When the journalist explained, the actress agreed that he shouldn’t host.  Now, after knowing the complete story, Young has tendered an apology. In a part of the much longer statement given to The Hollywood Reporter, she said, “I spoke on record about something I had no first-hand knowledge of. I trusted that the information that the journalist provided me with was complete, and I gave my general opinion based on the information he provided…” She went on, “I apologise to Ryan Seacrest. He has been exonerated from the allegations I was told about on the carpet, so my opinion is different now. I’ve learned that ‘I don’t know’ can be a complete answer.

The family was waiting anxiously at Anil Kapoor’s residence, which has temporarily become the mourning ground for the entire Kapoor family including the newly-weds, Mohit Marwah and his bride Antara.However, Boney’s surprise for his wife remains unfulfilled. Apparently, Sridevi wanted to move back into the family residence, which they had moved out of in Andheri, Mumbai, after a fire gutted their residence in 2013.  The accident could have proved catastrophic for the family. But Boney, Sridevi and the two daughters were safe. This was just after a major road accident where Boney escaped unhurt. Boney was getting the place ready as a big surprise for Sridevi’s birthday in August.Boney had then said, “Some power has protected me and my family. There is so much good that’s happening.

Honda says that the new model has been developed specifically for India at its Asia Pacific R&D centre in Thailand, based on findings drawn from extensive market surveys conducted in India. Here are the five most vital things you should know about the new Honda Amaze:DesignThe first-gen Honda Amaze was one of the nicer looking cars of the first crop of compact sedans and things have improved for the better on the second-gen model. There’s a more prominent bonnet section, a neatly done rear end and, in general, a greater balance to the design. There’s more than a hint of larger Honda sedans to the styling, and the grille design, with its chrome garnish, serves to link the Amaze to the updated City. New 10-spoke alloy wheels round up the changes on the outside.InteriorOn the inside, the new Amaze gets a touchscreen infotainment system that takes pride of place on the black-and-beige two-tone dashboard. Interior quality sees a jump up too and Honda seems to have carved out a vital few millimetres in every direction to make the cabin feel even more spacious than the original’s.PowertrainWhile Honda has not confirmed details yet, we can expect the current 88hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine and 100hp, 1.5-litre diesel motor to be carried over. The former’s option of a five-speed manual and CVT automatic continues, as does the latter’s five-speed manual. A highlight of the new Amaze will be the option of a diesel-automatic variant, one that will uniquely make use of a CVT gearbox.Rivals Replacing the current first-gen model, the new Amaze will rival the Maruti Suzuki Dzire (Rs 5.56-9.43 lakh), Hyundai’s Xcent (Rs 5.46-8.53 lakh), Volkswagen Ameo (Rs 5.50-9.99 lakh), Tata Tigor (Rs 4.71-6.99 lakh) and the upcoming, updated Ford Aspire.Launch date and pricingExpect the new model to cost a small premium over the outgoing model’s price tag, which stands at Rs 5.58-8.43 lakh for the petrol models and Rs 6.75-8.50 lakh for the diesel models. The top-spec CVT-diesel is expected to command a Rs 1 lakh premium over the current range-topping diesel variant, based on the differences between the petrol-manual and petrol-CVT options. Honda is expected to launch the new Amaze in India in the second quarter of 2018. More details about the compact sedan, like the safety features and equipment on offer, will emerge closer to the launch.

It also appointed Mr P. Deepak, lawyer, as the amicus curiae in the case and directed the state government to submit a report within 15 days about the incident.The chief justice has ordered to consider a letter on the issue written by Justice Surendramohan, holding charge of the Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KELSA),   as public interest litigation and file a case accordingly. The matter came up for consideration of the court on Wednesday. The letter pointed out that if a tribal youth was forced to steal food articles, it showed that the various welfare schemes had failed to meet their objectives. The petition also pointed out that the incident revealed the ethical and moral weakness of   society. The petition also called for revamping the welfare schemes according to the requirements of the members of the tribal community. The counsel for the government submitted that the issue was not confined to food alone and that a crime had taken place.', 'Mumbai: With some key players, including captain Virat Kohli, given a break, young Baroda all-rounder Deepak Hooda is optimistic of making his international debut in the upcoming T20 tri-nation series in Sri Lanka. Hooda was first picked in the Indian squad for the three-match bilateral T20 series versus Sri Lanka held last December at home, but did not get a game. The 22-year-old Rohtak-born player has been chosen again in the T20 squad, to be led by Rohit Sharma, and this time he hopes to get a game. With senior pros like Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni rested for the series, chances of youngsters like Hooda being given a chance in the tri-series, which kicks off from March 6 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, have brightened. “This is an important series. I did not get a chance (to play) in the first series (in which I was selected), I hope that I will now get a chance and I am prepared for it. I will give my 110 per cent,” Hooda said on Friday. Hooda, a right-handed batsman and right-arm off break bowler, has so far played 31 first class games for Baroda in which he has amassed 2208 runs. He has also taken seven wickets. The player said he had discussed a few things about the game with former skipper Dhoni when he shared the Indian team’s dressing room and was applying what the ex-skipper told him. “Yes that (being in the Indian dressing room) obviously helped. There are big players in the team, who have done so much for the nation. Speaking to them, you learn a lot,” he said. “I asked M S (Dhoni), that being (batting) at number five, what should be my thinking and we discussed it and he told me (about it) and I am applying it,” he added. Hooda has been to the island nation two times earlier and he said conditions there are similar to other Asian countries. ', 'Paris: Heavy snowfall and deadly blizzards lashed Europe on Thursday, forcing airports to cancel or delay flights around the continent, as a deep freeze gripped countries from the far north to the Mediterranean beaches in the south.The snowstorms, unusual for much of Europe at this time of year, left roads blocked, thousands of drivers stranded and schools shut, with weather agencies predicting the biting cold would continue in parts of the region at least through Thursday evening. The death toll Europe-wide continued to climb to more than 50, as another three people perished in Poland, taking the number of victims there to 21, most of them rough sleepers.There have also been six deaths in the Czech Republic in recent days, five in Lithuania, four each in France and Slovakia, three in Spain, two each in Italy, Serbia, Romania and Slovenia, and one each in Britain and the Netherlands.One of the Spanish victims was a 39-year-old homeless man who had been sleeping in an abandoned truck.“Those most at risk of cold-related illness include elderly people, children, and

Siberian cold front — dubbed the “Beast from the East” in Britain, “Siberian bear” by the Dutch and the “snow cannon” by Swedes — on Thursday forced Geneva airport to close for several hours in the morning, with temperatures plunging in Switzerland to nearly minus 40 degrees Celsius (minus 38 Fahrenheit) at higher altitudes.Scotland’s Glasgow airport remains closed until at least 1500 GMT, and Edinburgh airport said several airlines have decided not to fly because “they do not have the critical mass of staff needed to run operations securely”.Snow also forced the cancellation of all flight

of Montpellier, around 2,000 drivers were stranded on a motorway, causing anger from those sitting behind the wheel for hours on end.“The motorway looks like a cemetery of trucks and cars,” tweeted Anthony Jammot, describing an “apocalyptic” 24 hours in his car with two young children and no information or help from local authorities.In Paris, which awoke on Thursday under a blanket of snow, authorities continued operating emergency shelters for the city’s roughly 3,000 homeless.Demanding more efforts to keep people off the streets, around 30 local officials spent the night near the city’s Gare d’Austerlitz train station as temperatures dipped below zero.“We can’t keep considering the homeless just another part of the scenery,” Greens lawmaker Ali Id Elouali said.In Germany, the national homeless association urged shelters to open during the day and not just at night.“You can die of cold during the day too,” its chief Werena Rosenke warned.Authorities are also urging people to look out for elderly relatives and neighbours after a French woman in her nineties was found frozen to death outside her retirement home.Europe’s cold snap comes as the Arctic experiences

shot dead in a dormitory at Central Michigan University on Friday and police were hunting for a suspect, according to the Detroit Free Press.The suspect, a 19-year-old male, was considered “armed and dangerous,” according to the city of Mount Pleasant’s Twitter account.State police officials did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.The university, located about 125 miles (200 km) northwest of Detroit, had said on Twitter there were reports of shots fired at Campbell Hall.The incident came about two weeks after 17 students and educators were killed at a Florida high school.A university police official confirmed the department was monitoring the situation but declined to provide additional details.The United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said on Twitter it was sending special agents to assist.Central Michigan University is a four-year, public institution with more than 23,000 students enrolled, according to the college’s website.', 'Washington: The Pentagon on Thursday brushed off Russian President Vladimir Putin’s boast of developing “invincible” missiles, claiming the United States was fully prepared for anything that might come its way.In his state of the nation address, Putin described several advances in missile technology, including a hypersonic weapon that can fly at many times the speed of sound and evade existing missile defence systems. “We are not surprised by (Putin’s) statement, and the American people should rest assured that we are fully prepared,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said.White said she was “very confident” in America’s ability to react to “anything that may come our way.”“We are prepared and we are ready,” she said.Hypersonic weapons under development by Russia and China — as well as by the United States — can beat regular anti-missile defenses because they are designed to switch direction in flight and do not follow a predictable arc like conventional missiles, making them much harder to track and intercept.But despite the Pentagon’s claims, America is far from capable of stopping any type of missile attack, a fact it has lived with since the Cold War.While it has had some limited success in developing interceptors capable of stopping one or two missiles from a rogue regime like North Korea, a barrage of nukes from Russia or anywhere else would be unstoppable and trigger the “mutually assured destruction” of both nations.Still, US officials increasingly are turning attention to trying to develop some sort of defense against hypersonic missiles.In its proposed USD 9.9 billion requested budget for 2019, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is asking for USD 120 million to develop hypersonic missile defences, a big increase from the USD 75 million in fiscal 2018.', 'Scotland: Hywind Scotland, the world’s first floating wind farm, built by the company Statoil, has exceeded expectations of producing electricity off the coast of Aberdeenshire within three months, reports said.The plant produced 65 per cent of its theoretical capacity in November, December and January. In comparison, plants based on shore could produce only between 45 and 60 per cent of their theoretical capacity in the same time period.  Company officials are upbeat about the possibilities as it comes in the wake of a tough environment and challenges as the floating wind farm is subject to hurricane, eight-foot waves, and winter storms.“We tested Hywind technology under harsh weather for many years and it works,” said Beate Myking, senior vice-president of offshore wind operations in Statoil. “It is encouraging to see how well the turbines have performed have coped. Hywind Scotland’s high availability ensured that the volume of electricity generated is substantially higher than expected,” said Beate Myking Offshore wind farms are usually installed in shallow waters off the coast.However, this experiment has shown that there is potential for establishing wind farms via floating system off the coasts of places that have a steep drop off in water depth. Hywind has five turbines that each produce 6 megawatts. They’re floating over waters that are 328 feet deep. ', 'Chennai: An urn carrying the ashes of actor Sridevi was brought here  on Friday by her husband Boney Kapoor for immersion in the sea off Rameswaram. Since Sridevi lived and attained stardom in Chennai before she was launched in Bollywood, sources say that her husband Boney Kapoor wanted to perform the Hindu sacred rituals of immersion of her ashes in the sea off Rameswaram. Accordingly, the entire family, including Boney and his son Arjun Kapoor, Sri’s daughters Janhvi and Khushi, sister Maheshwari and others landed in Chennai on Friday post noon by a private aircraft, reportedly Falcon 2000 charter flight.  As reported by a few, they never travelled to Rameswaram and instead checked into a star hotel in the city. Later in the evening, the entire family and close relatives gathered at the Chennai residence of Sridevi at CIT Colony in Alwarpet and were seen offering their prayers for the late legendary actress.\\nNow, it is learnt that they will be leaving for Rameswaram early in the morning and conduct the rituals and immerse the ashes of Sri at the holy ‘Agni Theertham’ in the eastern seashore, which is believed to bring peace to the departed soul. Sridevi Boney Kapoor passed away in Dubai, where she went to attend the family wedding of Mohit Marwah. The actress was found unconscious in the bathroom by her husband Boney Kapoor. Her autopsy reports revealed that she died of ‘accidental drowning’ after loosing consciousness.

Mr Komatireddy  told mediapersons on Friday that the Chief Minister was facing counterfeit note and fake passport cases and called his son a ‘broker’. The Congress MLA alleged that the CM, his son and his daughter had ‘looted’ about Rs 10,000 crore and after the Congress came to power it would order a probe into the assets of KCR family.He said projects Mission Bhagiradha, Palamuru and Kaleswaram were aw-arded to Andhra contractors and had collected 10 per cent commission from them.The fibre cable wire-laying project was awarded to KTR’s brother-in-law for Rs 5,000 crore when it would actually cost Rs 500 crore.

The NDPP is contesting on 40 seats and the saffron party on 20.The Congress, which has given three chief ministers to Nagaland since the state’s inception in 1963, is contesting only in 18 seats, two less than the BJP.Votes would be counted in presence of the candidates and agents under the supervision of the respective district returning officers and assistant returning officers, state Additional CEO N Moa Aier said.', 'Bhadrachalam: Ten CPI Maoists and a constable of the Greyhound commando force were killed in an encounter in the forest areas of Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district bordering Telangana in the early hours of Friday.Six women were among the rebels killed in the clash that took place in Tadapalagutta-Pujari-Kanker forest area, about 40 km from Venkatapuram police station in Jayasankar-Bhupalapalli district of Telangana.  An AK-47, one SLR, two single bore rifles, five INSAS rifles, one .303 rifle, one pistol, three claymore mines, six rocket bombs, two solar plates, seven kit bags, a Sony radio, empty cartridges, live ammunition of different calibre, party literature and Rs 41,000 cash have been recovered from the encounter site. The Greyhound constable who died in the fight, Susheel Kumar, is a native of Vikarabad. The bodies of two of the Maoists, one a woman, were shifted to Bhadrachalam and placed in freezers in the area hospital. None of the slain Maoists have been identified. But it is speculated that Haribhushan, CPI-Maoist Telangana secretary, and his wife Sammakka were among those killed. It is also suspected that  Haribhushan’s sister Bharathi and his brother Ashok were in Bhadrachalam. According to the police, a joint operation of the Telangana and Chhattisgarh police was underway early on Friday morning and ran into a group of Maoists who opened fire indiscriminately, resulting in the death of the Greyhound constable Sushil Kumar. The police returned fire, which killed 10 Maoists.', 'Bengaluru: Has the  Anti Corruption Bureau closed a case on corruption  and VVIP treatment extended to jail inmates in Bengaluru central jail at Parappana Agrahara   before the state government could take a final call on the report of Vinay Kumar Commission that had examined the issue and recommended a fresh inquiry?Nearly four months after the report was submitted to the government, the state government accepted the report on Feb. 26 and a sheet containing the information on the Vinay Kumar report was released to the media on March 1. According to the information shared with media, a fresh inquiry should be ordered against Krishna Kumar and Anitha, two prisons officials who were accused of extending VVIP treatment to Sasikala. The committee, according to the information shared with the media, also recommended a separate inquiry on alleged bribery by the Anti-Corruption Bureau. Instead of doing so, the ACB closed the case and an order to this effect was issued on January 12.The then DIG (prisons) D. Roopa had made allegations of corruption and VVIP treatment in Bengaluru prisons. She prepared a detailed report on the charges and submitted it to home department, DG&IG and ACB. The ACB that inquired the matter also recorded her statement last year on August 19 vis-a-vis the corruption and VVIP treatment case. Finally, in January, Superintendent Kala Krishnaswamy issued an order closing the case saying, “During the investigations, no evidences supporting the allegations made by Ms Roopa. The case was closed.”', 'When he made Pad Man, Akshay Kumar had already met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his earlier film Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. And then came paeans from Bill Gates, praising his effort in the film about sanitation for women in Indian villages and small towns.Khiladi Kumar was on a high. His social messages through Bollywood films were taking him places. He did not even take his fee for the R. Balki directed Pad Man, which was a home production along with KriArj Entertainment. “Akshay was very hopeful that the film would be declared tax free across many Indian states, more-so because he paid another visit to Modi in an effort to do so. But then the tax-free status never came, even after the film was postponed. Despite meeting the Prime Minister and the subsequent delay in the release of the film, it never got a tax-free status,” says a trade source. The film’s collection at the end of the third weekend stood at less than Rs 80 crore and in no way seems to come close to the Rs 100 crore mark — a standard Akshay has maintained in most recent films. The actor had said, “I am not thinking of Rs 100 crore, or Rs 300 crore as the media and others are talking. I was sitting outside my vanity van the other day and there were four boys talking about the film’s trailer and they spoke on how sanitary pads are being worn. That for me, is the biggest achievement we could have had with our film. I am happy that we are achieving what we set out to.” ', 'Tabu has never shied away from experimenting, and she has proved it time and again. With web series being the new flavour of season, Tabu reveals that she too has been approached for a project.She confirms, “I have gotten a few offers for web series, but I want the project to be credible enough for me to be a part of it. I want to be sure when I go ahead with that set-up. I am contemplating the idea.”  A host of Bollywood personalities (read: Kalki Koechlin, Parineeti Chopra, Richa Chadha and Nimrat Kaur among others) have been a part of web series in the recent past. In retrospect, Tabu believes it is only a matter of time that Bollywood jumped into it. She says, “I think we have to accept any kind of change that comes in our industry. I am open to doing web series, depending on who’s involved in it.” The actress, who is also extremely private about her personal life, also doesn’t believe in socialising more. She adds that it is a big deal for someone like her even to be on Instagram, the photo-sharing app.She says, “I am on Instagram — and that is a big deal. I don’t know if I can ever be on a social media platform, because I am not someone who will share my thoughts or opinion with everybody. I don’t do this even with my closest friends. I can’t do it with 10 million people. It is a little too difficult for me to do that.”', 'New Delhi: US tech-giant Apple’s introduction of the Apple Watch Series 3 in September 2017 is slowly but surely cornering the wearables market. With eight million shipments in the fourth quarter, Apple has become the leader in the global wearables market, a report by International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker has said.In the fourth quarter, Apple shipped eight million wearables with a 21% market share and 57.5% year-over-year growth, the IDC report said.According to the IDC report, the fourth quarter of 2017 was the first quarter that Apple held the market leader position all to itself after spending several quarters close behind Fitbit or Xiaomi. Apple is catching the market at the right time with many users of basic wearables moving on to smartwatches and cellular connectivity (available on select Series 3 Watches) is earning a warm reception among end users, the report said.The late-year push of eight million units separated Apple from the competition to emerge as the overall leader of the wearables market for the year, the report added.“User tastes have become more sophisticated over the past several quarters and Apple pounced on the demand for cellular connectivity and streaming multimedia,” Ramon T Llamas, Research Director for IDC’s Wearables team, said in a statement.The Series 3 of the Apple Watch features wireless LTE connectivity, where customers make phone calls or send text messages from the watch without needing to have an iPhone nearby.The ability to make calls with a wristwatch has captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts at least since it was prominently featured in “Dick Tracy”, the comic about a private detective who, starting in 1946, used calls from his wrist to help bust bad guys.The top five wearables companies for the fourth quarter of 2017 are Apple followed by Fitbit, Xiaomi, Garmin and Huawei.', 'Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA) has brought out a new off-road utility vehicle, for the US market, named the Roxor. The carmaker is trying to leverage its image as a maker of agricultural and utility vehicles in the USA and will assemble the new model in Detroit. Besides being sold as a side by side or utility vehicle (classified as an off-highway vehicle in the US), Mahindra will also supply the vehicle to the US Federal postal service.The new off-roader looks like the Mahindra Thar, from the grille to the wheel arches, which isn’t surprising considering the Roxor is based on the Thar. Hence, the Roxor features a steel body on a boxed steel frame. It is powered by a 64hp, 2.5-litre four-cylinder diesel engine and a five-speed manual gearbox.Meant to be a hardy vehicle in the mould of the Thar, the Roxor gets four-wheel-drive as standard. As it falls in the off-highway category of motor vehicles in the US, top speed is limited to 72kph. Mahindra is trying to position the Roxor as a rival to other side by sides like the Polaris RZR ATV and the Kawasaki Mule Pro series. Interestingly, while others in the segment typically use smaller two-cylinder engines and all-round independent suspension, Mahindra have used a four-cylinder engine and simpler leaf sprung rigid axles at the front and rear. Another interesting bit is the use of a five-slat grille on the Roxor, unlike the typical seven-slat grille of Mahindra’s current vehicles, also seen on Jeeps.For the first six months, the two-seat Roxor will be offered with few customisation options. However, everything from the exterior and interior colours, safari seats and back seats and ride heights to the hard tops, winches and side enclosures will be offered with a high level of personalisation. In fact, buyers will be able to select from over 900 paint shades.Mahindra will not retail the Roxor through a standard dealership network, but instead through a new powersports dealer network, which would help it tap into the powersports market. The model is the Indian carmakers first from the new assembly plant in southeast Michigan.  There is no word on when the Roxor will launch officially in the US, though Mahindra is expected to share more details on that towards the end of this month.Mahindra have been assembling the American Willys in India since the 1940s and for long, used the Jeep name under licence, although the Indian carmaker no longer holds the rights to the Jeep brand at the launch of the Roxor, Mahindra did make a clear reference to their American ties.', 'THOOTHUKUDI: Seized red sanders logs estimated to be worth Rs 6 crore and kept in customs custody in Thoothukudi is reportedly missing.The missing consignment of red sanders said to weigh 15 tonnes, allegedly meant to be smuggled to Malaysia from Bengaluru through Thoothukudi port in 2013, was seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths.  The seized consignment was kept in customs custody at a private Container Freight Station (CFS) that has been licensed to be the customs cargo service provider for custody of seized consignment.As the case dealt by the Madurai special economic offences court was over and the court directed to put up the seized red sanders for auction, the Customs department officials opened the container at the private CFS only to find hay stacks, instead of the red sander logs.Preliminary enquiry by the Customs officials here too revealed that the Customs department seal punched with the court case number at the lock was found tampered with and a fake number had been punched on it.According to Customs department sources, the red sander woods must have been smuggled out from the freight station either with the knowledge of the owners of the CFS, or by the CFS employees unknown to the owners on a holiday. Customs department sleuths, however, registered a case against the private CFS and are investigating. “Clearing other custodial consignments kept in storage at the private CFS too have been shifted to another licensed  customs cargo service provider,”said a customs official, who too added that they have written to the director general of Logistics to cancel the license of the private CFS.

Periaiah, the R S Puram police on Thursday night busted a four-member gang of alleged ganja-peddlers.Police said that recently five private college students in the city were arrested for ganja peddling. After getting vital information from them, city police commissioner K.Periaiah formed a special team comprising sub-inspectors Shastha Somasekaran, Ghanasekaran and Jothi to nab the wholesale ganja dealers in the city.  The special team checked vehicles near Seeranaickenpalayam on Thursday evening and found a car with 216 kg of ganja packed in 108 bundles. Police arrested the four persons in the car and seized the ‘ganja’ consignment along with the car used for smuggling.The offenders were identified as Dharma alias Dharmar, 50, his younger brother Irulandi, 43, from Muthalamparai  in Theni, Pandeeswaran, 23, and Sathishkumar, 33, from Andipatti in Theni. During investigations they reportedly confessed to the crime and said that they were hired by one Kumar, a  wholesale ganja dealer residing near Malumachampatty. ', 'Los Angeles: World number two Rafael Nadal announced his withdrawal from this month’s ATP Masters events in Miami and Indian Wells on Friday, citing a leg injury that forced him to pull out the Mexican Open.Nadal said in a statement on Facebook the injury, which flared in Acapulco this week, was in the same area as the hip problem that led to his exit from the Australian Open in January. “I won’t be able to play in Miami or Indian Wells as I need to recover,” Nadal said.“It was very painful to retire from Acapulco and it’s very hard as well to not play in the USA. I will miss you and I will do everything that’s possible to be back there in 2019.”The 31-year-old 16-time Grand Slam winner had been left distraught on Tuesday after suddenly pulling out of Acapulco just hours before his opening match. It marked the sixth tournament in a row that Nadal has pulled out of or retired from — Basel, Paris, the London ATP Tour Finals, Brisbane, Australian Open and Acapulco.Nadal’s withdrawal was greeted with dismay by Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas.“We are disappointed that Rafa will not be able to compete for the third title at this year’s BNP Paribas Open,” Haas said. “We wish him all the best for a speedy recovery.”Nadal, who turns 32 in June, ended 2017 as the oldest year-end world number one in the 45-year history of the ATP rankings.

The former Paris Saint-Germain forward has not played for United since their 2-2 draw against Burnley on December 26, having decided that he was not in the right shape after recovering from career-threatening cruciate knee ligament damage sustained in April.Ibrahimovic has made only seven appearances for United this term, scoring just once in a shock League Cup loss at Bristol City. He hopes to return in time for the second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Sevilla at Old Trafford a week on Tuesday, but United boss Mourinho said the Swede’s long-term plans may lie away from Manchester.“For Zlatan, we all think it’s his last season at Manchester United and it will be a very personal decision for him to play or to stop,” Mourinho told reporters on Friday.“I think he won the right to choose his life, his future, such an amazing player and an amazing career.“Only that awful injury in the wrong moment broke a fantastic couple of seasons he could and should have with us.“This season has been really difficult for him. He’s not injured. Does he feel totally happy, ready and convinced that he’s in the condition to help the team in this moment? No.“But he’s such an honest guy and such a champion he only wants to be back with that feeling of: ‘I’m totally ready for it’.“So he’s working hard and hopefully his evolution brings him to that level he wants to have a positive answer.”         Fellaini future in the balance           Ibrahimovic might not be the only high-profile departure from United this summer.Mourinho, whose side start the weekend in second place as they prepare for Monday’s Premier League trip to Crystal Palace, has admitted that Marouane Fellaini’s future also remains in the balance.The Belgium midfielder is out of contract at the end of the season, and is reported to have rejected two offers to extend it.Fellaini, 30, has not played since suffering a knee injury that needed surgery against Tottenham at the end of January, but is expected to be fit for the Champions League quarter-finals in early April if United get there.“He’s still a young player. His injury had minor surgery and he will be back to play again in a couple of week,” Mourinho said.“So if we proceed in the Champions League after Sevilla, I think he will be ready for a hypothetical quarter-final, a hypothetical FA Cup semi-final, and for the last couple of months of our Premier League fight.“Is he going to stay or leave? I don’t know. I want him to stay, the club want him to stay.“But with the process, the negotiations, the numbers, and the distances between the offer and what he wants, I really don’t know.”Mourinho added that he was uncertain as to whether England boss Gareth Southgate has met Scott McTominay over his international future. Lancaster-born McTominay, 21, is also eligible for Scotland through his father, and it is understood that Southgate is keen to get the midfielder to commit to England.“I don’t know if that is true. I can’t confirm because I have no information about that and my advice to him is not about national teams,” Mourinho said.“My advice is to keep being the way he is: Very humble, very open to learn, intelligent. He has to keep going in the same direction, with the same profile, trying to fight to have minutes with Manchester United, which is not easy.”', 'New Delhi: Former India seamer Venkatesh Prasad on Saturday tendered his resignation from the post of chairman, junior national selection committee, less than a month after the country won the U-19 World Cup.Prasad, who has worked as the head of the junior national selection committee for 30 months, of late shared a cold relationship with the BCCI mandarins. It has been learnt that Prasad cited personal reasons for stepping down and has also mentioned that he doesn’t want to fall under the purview of ‘Conflict of Interest’.“It’s still not clear but there are chances that he might be joining any IPL franchise and that’s why he wanted to avoid a potential conflict of interest,” a senior BCCI official said from Mumbai.When acting president C K Khanna was asked about the resignation, he said: “I tried to convince him but it seems he has made up his mind. He has been one of the finest talent spotters and deserves due credit in selecting a world champion junior team.”Prasad, in 2016, was tipped to become the chairman of the senior selection committee, but BCCI decided to continue with him in the junior panel.Interestingly, Prasad is only one among the six national selectors (3 juniors and 3 seniors) to have played more international matches than all senior selectors put together (33 Tests and 161 ODIs).Recently, after the Indian junior team won the U-19 World Cup, the selection panel was not given any cash reward.However, the senior selection panel and women’s panel had been handsomely rewarded by BCCI after both the senior men’s and women’s team lost the finals of the Champions Trophy and World Cup respectively.COA member Diana Edulji had gone on record saying “selectors were rewarded for selecting good team” — a comment that had raised a few eyebrows as both teams lost their summit clashes.However, many believe that Prasad had irked a senior office bearer and that is why the junior selection committee never got cash award after the World Cup triumph.', 'Durban: Australia took a firm grip on the first Test at Sahara Stadium on Friday as South Africa struggled first to avoid the follow on target and then get anywhere close to the visitors’ first innings total on the second day.AB de Villiers stood man alone as none of the other specialist batsmen stayed long enough to share a substantial partnership with him. The major damage was done first by the spin of Nathan Lyon and then by the ability of Mitchell Starc to reverse swing the old ball effectively. De Villiers was denied the opportunity to score his 6th century against Australia when he ran out of partners (71 off 127 balls, 11 fours) as the Proteas were bowled out for 162 in only 51.4 overs. It left the Proteas with a massive first innings deficit of 189 with Australia to start their second innings at the start of the third day’s play.Aiden Markram’s 32 was the second-best batting contribution for the Proteas. Starc finished off the innings abruptly with figures of 5/34 in only 10.4 overs while Lyon picked up 3/50.Starc has had a good all-round match to date as his eighth wicket partnership of 49 with Mitchell Marsh was a key contribution as well.With Marsh falling just four runs short of his third Test match century (96 off 173 balls, 13 fours and a six) Australia were able to post exactly 100 runs for their last three partnerships and that made an enormous difference to the total that the Proteas had to face. A total of 351 was probably a little bit better than par, bearing in mind the abrasive nature of the pitch and the spin that has been available throughout.Keshav Maharaj claimed his fourth five-wicket haul (5/123 in 33.4 overs) and it came as no surprise that Steve Smith introduced Lyon into the Australian attack as early as the start of the eighth over. He achieved immediate success, getting rid of Dean Elgar and Hashim Amla in the space of his first five deliveries and the Proteas never really recovered.

A delegation of three central leaders of the Congress – Kamal Nath, Ahmed Patel and CP Joshi had met the governor on Saturday.Meanwhile, breaking his silence on the defeat in three Northeast states, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said on Monday that the party was committed to winning back the people’s trust and hit out at the BJP, accusing it of “usurping” power through proxy in Meghalaya and using “big money” to create an “opportunistic alliance”.', 'KOLKATA: Giving out the slogan of ‘Delhi Chalo’, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee vowed to imprint her party’s footsteps in the national capital.She asserted that if the saffron party targets to establish its rule in Bengal, her aim is Delhi and the Red Fort.The Trinamool Congress would not look for any benefits other than the betterment of the country, she added.She also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of trying to trigger a communal riot in the state by throwing meat in religious places and announced cash reward of Rs 1,000 or jobs to people who catch such offenders.“Bengal does not want anything but the betterment of the country. Our target is the Red Fort in Delhi. Let`s go to Delhi. We believe in Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s slogan – ‘Delhi Chalo’. So Bengal will win over the country, win over the world in future,” Banerjee said in a public meeting here.She further said that Bengal would stand by everyone in the fight against the Centre but would not demand any benefit for themselves.“Bengal will not take anything for themselves but they will stand by everyone. They will take everyone along and fight. They will show what Bengal can do, no one else can,” she claimed amid massive cheers from the crowd.Attacking the ruling BJP at the Centre, the TMC supremo accused them of trying to buy off the poor people by giving out cash and dividing people along communal lines.“Being poor and coming from a poor family is not a crime but if someone tries to buy off the poor men by giving money, that is a crime. When someone tries to bring people on their side by triggering communal riot, that is a crime,” she said.Charging the BJP-RSS with trying to trigger a communal riot by secretly throwing meat in religious places, she urged the police to form community development committees in every locality to catch the offenders and to engage local people in keeping an eye on such incidents.“They have started a new conspiracy recently. They are giving money to some people and asking them to throw meat in temples and mosques. This is a conspiracy, a deliberate attempt to inflict a communal riot by the BJP-RSS,” Banerjee said during an administrative meeting in Jhargram.“They are doing this to set off a riot between the two communities. I am sure they would try the same trick during Ram Navami. I do not need to see who is Hindu and who is Muslim. I am in favour of everyone. An offender is an offender.”Banerjee said she has instructed the inspectors in-charge in all police stations to be alert.“We have seen this happening in two places in the North 24 Parganas district in quick succession. Some BJP-RSS activists were arrested in the incident in Habra. That`s why I am taking their name. If Trinamool Congress activists had been arrested, I would have mentioned them as well,” said the Trinamool Congress supremo.“Involve the local public. If someone catches such offenders, award him or her with a prize money of Rs 1,000. I will provide jobs to some and money to others if they successfully intercept such offenders,” she added.', 'New Delhi:  Indian and Chinese troops have “redeployed” themselves away from the face-off site in Doklam, and China has undertaken construction of helipads, sentry posts and trenches for its army personnel there, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.“Post disengagement from the face-off in 2017, troops of both sides have redeployed themselves away from their respective positions at the face-off site. The strength of both sides have been reduced,” she said replying to a question on the issue in Rajya Sabha. “In order to maintain these troops during the winter, People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has undertaken construction of some infrastructure, including sentry posts, trenches and helipads,” she said.Last week, junior Defence Minister Subhash Bhamre had said that the situation along India’s border with China is “sensitive” and it has the potential to escalate.Sitharaman’s reply on Monday came in response to a question on whether satellite images have revealed that China has constructed seven helipads in Doklam besides deploying tanks and missiles in the area.On whether India has taken up the matter with China, she said issues relating to the border are regularly taken up with the Chinese side through diplomatic channels and at Border Personnel Meetings, flag meetings and meetings of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs.Troops of India and China were locked in a 73-day-long standoff in Doklam from June 16 last year after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. The face-off ended on August 28.Sources said China has been keeping its troops in north Doklam and significantly ramping up its infrastructure in the disputed area.In January, Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat had said the time had come for India to shift its focus from borders with Pakistan to the frontier with China, indicating the seriousness of the situation.To a separate question on a Pentagon report which said China was setting up a military base in Pakistan, Bhamre said the government keeps a constant watch on developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes measures to safeguard it.“Government is aware of China’s stated objective of becoming a ‘maritime power’. As part of this strategy, China is developing ports and other infrastructure facilities in the littoral countries in the Indian Ocean Region, including in the vicinity of India’s maritime boundary,” he said.He said India and China have, on several occasions, reiterated that as large neighbours following independent foreign policies, the relationship pursued by the two nations with other countries must not become a source of concern for each other.', 'Hyderabad: Emboldened by the response he has received from several political leaders and from his own party cadres, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has chalked out a plan to take his Third Front proposal to the national level by organising meetings in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.Mr Rao has lined up a series of meetings with retired All India Service officers, retired defence officials, legal luminaries, national farmers’ associations, economists and other such groupings from all states to get their feedback on devising an agenda for the Third Front. Mr Rao has called for a qualitative change in politics. The first meetings will be with those who have administrative experience such as retired IAS, IPS, IFS and IRS officers. Meetings are also planned with retired defence personnel, national farmers’ associations, and economists.These meetings will be followed by meetings with media houses, journalists, industrial houses, labour organisations and so on.These meetings will be held in Hyderabad, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru etc. Work is already on to organise these meetings and lists of various organisations are being drawn up. The idea behind these meetings is that all those who have been thinking about the state of the nation in various ways should be participants in the process of the qualitative change in politics that Mr Rao wants to bring about.', 'Bengaluru: IT capital Bengaluru became the first city in the country – mimicking Sao Paulo in Brazil – to have a HeliTaxi on Monday when a privately owned helicopter service took to the skies, delivering its first three passengers to Kempegowda International Airport from Electronic City in 15 minutes, which otherwise would have taken nearly two hours by road. The first helitaxi, a Bell 407 helicopter, with three passengers on board, lifted off at 3.35 pm from a Thumby Aviation helipad in Electronic City to KIA on Monday. Group Captain (retired) K N G Nair, chairman and managing director of Kerala-based Thumby Aviation – named for a butterfly – said: “While our first helicopter started its service from 6.30 am, that was promotional. The maiden heli-taxi started  from Electronic City to KIAL on Monday afternoon.”Bookings can be made by downloading the Thumby mobile app (Heli Taxii) where seats can be booked online. Seats can also be booked on the spot at the company’s counter at KIA and at Thumby’s facility at Electronic City. Passengers can avail of the company’s heliport facility within the international airport, which is just about a kilometer away from KIA. Passengers are picked from the airport and dropped back and the charge for this is included in the heli taxi ticket. BBMP looks to skies to beat traffic woes\\nWhy complain about potholes or argue about flyovers when you can fly? The BBMP, which has taken to a somewhat ostentatious route to proving its efficiency, has flagged off a privately-owned heli-taxi service in the city. The Palike earmarked Rs 8 crore in the 2018-19 budget towards constructing helipads in each zone for “air ambulances” and to facilitate the movement of VIPS. This was despite criticism that the funds could be better utilised for other areas of public infrastructure and Bengaluru now has the distinction of being only the second city in the world to have helicopters used as taxis. Three passengers made it to KIA from Electronics City in 15 minutes on the service’s maiden journey, instead of two hours by road. The company has two facilities – within the international airport, where a heliport is set up, which is just about a kilometer away from KIA. Passengers are picked from airport and dropped back and the charge for this is included in the heli taxi ticket. Group Captain (retired) K.N.G. Nair, chairman and managing director of Kerala-based Thumby Aviation says that the launch is only the inaugural step in the effort to provide affordable heli-taxi services. “We are gearing up to engage nearly 93 existing helipads in the city including ones at hotels like ITC Gardenia and Crowne Plaza.”The company also offers individual charters to locations like Coorg, Mangalore, Mysore and Wayanad and are considering an air-ambulance service.\\nThe company did not wish to reveal details of the bookings on Monday but said later that there have been queries from potential customers. Air Ambulances next in line?\\nThe BBMP earmarked Rs 5 crores for the constructions of helipads in all of its eight zones to provide “air ambulance services” and to facilitate the movement of VIPs. Thumby Aviations has said it is up to this task too. Captain Nair praised the BBMP’s proposal, calling it a revolution in emergency health care. “Getting assistance during the golden hour is crucial to saving lives.” Helicopters used as ambulances can be equipped with ICU-like facilities including a ventilator, oxygen cylinders and a dedicated medical team, Nair added. ', 'Washington became the first state Monday to set up its own net-neutrality requirements after US regulators repealed Obama-era rules that banned Internet providers from blocking content or interfering with online traffic.“We know that when D.C. fails to act, Washington state has to do so,” Gov. Jay Inslee said before signing the measure that lawmakers passed with bipartisan support. “We know how important this is.” As he has done frequently over the past year, Inslee took aim at President Donald Trump’s administration, saying the decision by the Federal Communications Commission was “a clear case of the Trump administration favoring powerful corporate interests over the interests of millions of Washingtonians and Americans.”The FCC voted in December to gut US rules that meant to prevent broadband companies such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon from exercising more control over what people watch and see on the internet. The regulations also prohibited providers from favoring some sites and apps over others.Because the FCC prohibited state laws from contradicting its decision, opponents of the Washington law have said it would lead to lawsuits.Inslee said he was confident of its legality, saying “the states have a full right to protect their citizens.”The new law also requires internet providers to disclose information about their management practices, performance and commercial terms. Violations would be enforceable under the state’s Consumer Protection Act.While several states introduced similar measures this year seeking to protect net neutrality, so far only Oregon and Washington have passed legislation. But Oregon’s measure wouldn’t put any new requirements on internet providers.It would stop state agencies from buying internet service from any company that blocks or prioritizes specific content or apps, starting in 2019. It’s unclear when Oregon’s measure would be signed into law.Washington state was among more than 20 states and the District of Columbia that sued in January to try and block the FCC’s action. There are also efforts by Democrats to undo the move in Congress.Governors in five states — Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Montana and Vermont — have signed executive orders related to net-neutrality issues, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Montana’s order, for instance, bars telecommunications companies from receiving state contracts if they interfere with internet traffic or favor higher-paying sites or apps.Big telecom companies have said net neutrality rules could undermine investment in broadband and introduce uncertainty about what are acceptable business practices. Net-neutrality advocates say the FCC decision harms innovation and make it harder for the government to crack down on internet providers who act against consumer interests.The FCC’s new rules are not expected to go into effect until later this spring. Washington’s law will take effect in June. Ron Main, executive director of the Broadband Communications Association of Washington, which opposed the bill, said the cable companies his group represents have already pledged not to block legal content or engage in paid prioritisation.He said that because the Internet is an interstate service, only Congress can pass legislation “that gives all consumers and internet services providers the clarity and consistency needed for a free and open internet.”“There should not be a state-by-state patchwork of differing laws and regulations,” he said in a statement.', 'Over 9,300 people were booked for different traffic violations, including over 1,900 for drunken driving, across Delhi on the occasion of Holi.Out of 1,918 cases of drunken driving, 608 cases were from the southern part of the capital, a senior police official said on Friday.The police also booked 4,634 two-wheeler riders for not wearing helmets while 1,164 were challaned for triple-riding on motorcycles and scooters, he added.A total of 1,589 people were booked for other violations, the police said.The Delhi Police had yesterday made elaborate arrangements to prevent any untoward incident during Holi celebrations and deployed a huge number of personnel to maintain law and order, and prevent violation of traffic rules in the city.Traffic police teams with interceptors and PCR, and local police officials were stationed at strategic intersections all over Delhi to check drunken driving, over-speeding and other violations, officials added.', 'NEW DELHI:  Vietnam President Tran Dai Quang arrived in New Delhi on Friday on a three-day visit to India at the invitation of his Indian counterpart President Ram Nath Kovind.“Warm welcome to the Vietnamese President, Tran Dai Quang and his wife Nguyen Thi Hien on a state visit to India!,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar tweeted.“Vietnam is an important pillar in India’s #Act East Policy and the two countries share civilisational relationship spanning over 2000 years,” Mr Kumar said.President Quang had landed in Bodh Gaya in Bihar, a Buddhist pilgrimage site, earlier on Friday before reaching New Delhi.Vietnam is an important partner in southeast Asia and is currently the country coordinator for India with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional bloc, a role that will be handed over to Thailand later this year.Apart from Asean, India and Vietnam closely cooperate in other regional forums such as the East Asia Summit, Mekong Ganga Cooperation, Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) besides the UN and WTO.India-Vietnam trade stood at $6.24 billion in fiscal 2016-17 and the two sides have agreed to raise this to $15 billion by 2020.Defence has emerged as an important pillar of the bilateral relationship and Indian ships regularly make friendly port calls to Vietnam.COMMENTSIndia is also an important development aid partner for Vietnam and has extended several lines of credit for capacity building in the southeast Asian nation.Vietnam is also among the larger recipients of scholarships offered under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme.', 'New Delhi: Does holding your partner’s hand help your pain subside? No, it isn’t love – it has been shown why this happens and it has something to do with your brainwaves.A study has found that holding your partner’s hand helps the brainwaves sync and reduces pain.As per the study’s findings, the more empathy a comforting partner feels for a partner in pain, the more their brainwaves fall into sync. And the more those brain waves sync, the more the pain goes away.“We have developed a lot of ways to communicate in the modern world and we have fewer physical interactions. This paper illustrates the power and importance of human touch,” said the lead author of the study Pavel Goldstein, from the University of Colorado at Boulder.For the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), researchers recruited a group of heterosexual couples, aged between 23 to 32 who had been together for at least one year.The researchers put them through several two-minute scenarios as electroencephalography (EEG) caps measured their brainwave activity.The scenarios included sitting together not touching; sitting together holding hands, and sitting in separate rooms. Then they repeated the scenarios as the woman was subjected to mild heat pain on her arm.Merely being in each other’s presence, with or without touch, was associated with some brainwave synchronicity in the alpha mu band, a wavelength associated with focused attention. If they held hands while she was in pain, the coupling increased the most, the researchers said.The researchers also found that when she was in pain and he couldn’t touch her, the coupling of their brain waves diminished.“It appears that pain totally interrupts this interpersonal synchronization between couples and touch brings it back,” the researchers said.“You may express empathy for a partner’s pain, but without touch, it may not be fully communicated,” they added.', 'Mumbai: They may have been one of the most romantic pairs on screen, but Kamal Haasan and late female superstar Sridevi shared a bond like that of siblings.“Sridevi en thangachi (Sridevi was my younger sister),” Haasan said, decades after he was paired opposite Sridevi in a number of Tamil films such as ‘Guru’, ‘Varumayin Niram Sivappu’, ‘Vaazhve Maayam’ and ‘Moondram Pirai’, the last one being also remade as Hindi classic ‘Sadma’ in 1983. Sridevi, who died of accidental drowning in her hotel bath tub in Dubai last week, captured millions of hearts across India as a Bollywood diva. She had started her career in Tamil cinema industry, besides doing some Telugu films.She later moved to Mumbai to enjoy a successful career in Hindi cinema.Writing in the concluding part of his weekly series in Tamil magazine ‘Ananda Vikatan,’ Haasan, now a politician, said he was revealing the nature of his bond with the late Sridevi as he does not stand the risk of his “market” getting affected now.“Those days, couples (at weddings) were compared to us, saying they looked like Kamal and Sridevi. They must have seen us singing duets and hugging. We hid the truth (about the nature of the relationship) so as to not shatter that dream,” he said.Drawing parallels with the children donning the roles of god couples Murugan-Valli or Krishna-Rukmini in plays, Haasan said the boy playing the said roles would often describe the girl as ‘thangachi’, meaning younger sister.“Me and Sridevi were like one such annan-thangachi (brother and sister),” he added.Indicating that people in the industry had a fair idea about this, Haasan said he was asked not to speak about it “since you are being celebrated as a couple.”Haasan said after doing three films together with her, he was in the mindset of “Sridevi again?” for another script, adding that she herself could have shared similar thoughts.But none consulted the two and “they (apparently the producers and directors) decided “that the two will pair opposite each other,” he said, adding, after a point of time, “all heroes desired to act with her.”“If our acting was watched keenly, we would look like siblings. One could find resemblance of myself in her acting,” he said.During the course of their career, Sridevi would often seek Haasan’s opinions on her films and would patiently listen to his criticism.While she did not dub in her voice in her first two Hindi films, she did so in her third project, Haasan recalled.The deceased actor “became Sridevi by sheer hard work,” he said, and pointed out to her commitment.Expressing sadness over the death of his one-time co- star, he said many senior women actors had called him up and cried following the death of the 54-year-old actor.', 'Paris: Amazon chief Jeff Bezos is now the world’s richest person, having snatched the top spot from Microsoft founder Bill Gates who slips to second place, according to Forbes magazine’s annual billionaires list published Tuesday.US President Donald Trump’s ranking on the list fell to 766th place from 544th in the last edition, his wealth now being estimated at $3.1 billion, $400 million less than a year ago.Thanks to a 59-percent rise in Amazon shares over the past 12 months, Bezos almost doubled his fortune, taking it to $120 billion, way ahead of Gates’s $90 billion — the biggest gap ever between the number one and two spots, Forbes said.Legendary investor Warren Buffett held on to his number three ranking, followed by French industrialist Bernard Arnault, who jumped to fourth-richest person from his previous number 11 spot, mostly thanks to euro strength against the dollar, the magazine said.Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg was fifth on the list.Two Chinese billionaires rose to be among the 20 richest people in the world: Ma Huateng, CEO of Chinese internet giant Tencent who is the richest person in Asia and  number 17 in the world,  and Alibaba founder Jack Ma.There are now a record 2,208 billionaires in the world, Forbes counted, and their combined worth is $9.1 trillion, up 18 percent from last year.The US has the most billionaires (585), followed by mainland China (373).Forbes’ list contains 259 newcomers, including the first-ever cryptocurrency billionaires.', 'Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, who was admitted to Lilavati hospital in Mumbai on Monday, left for the US for further treatment late Tuesday night. Parrikar’s personal secretary Rupesh Kumawat told mediapersons on Tuesday night that Parrikar was flying to America as there was not much improvement in his health condition.The announcement of the former defence minister travelling to US for treatment was made on official Twitter handle of the Goa Chief Minister’s office. A tweet posted by CMO Goa on Tuesday said, “As advised by Doctors at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, Hon’ble Chief Minister @manoharparrikar will be leaving tonight to USA for further treatment.”Parrikar, 62, was admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai on February 15, 2018, and discharged on February 22, 2018. On the same day he returned to Goa and presented the Budget in the assembly, but the session was truncated to only four days owing to his illness.He was later admitted to the Goa Medical College and Hospital after he suffered from dehydration.Before leaving for Mumbai on Monday, Parrikar had held a series of meetings, including one with senior state ministers.A three-member Cabinet Advisory Committee of Sudin Dhavalikar (MGP), Francis D’Souza (BJP) and Vijai Sardesai (Goa Forward Party) was also formed to advise the administration in his absence. In a video message, Parrikar had appealed to people to continue praying for his health. “I am thankful for all. In the last 15 days, you have been praying for me and you have blessed me because of which I got well and to get fully cured I may go abroad,” he said.“The way you have prayed for me and blessed me, I hope to get the same thing during my treatment there. I expect that you all will allow me a leave for some days from the state for the treatment,” the CM said.', 'Holders Real Madrid cruised into the Champions League quarter-finals with Cristiano Ronaldo`s second-half goal helping them to a 2-1 victory at Paris St Germain on Tuesday as the 12-time European champions went through 5-2 on aggregate.Ronaldo headed home seven minutes into the second half and Casemiro added a second 10 minutes from time against a toothless PSG, who were without their injured talisman Neymar and had Marco Verratti sent off for a second booking in the 66th minute.Ronaldo scored for the ninth Champions League game in a row, matching Ruud van Nistelrooy`s record in the competition, before PSG striker Edinson Cavani equalised with 19 minutes left, only for Casemiro to give Real victory at the Parc des Princes.Zinedine Zidane`s side, who are 15 points adrift of arch-rivals Barcelona in La Liga but aiming for their third straight Champions League crown, were solid throughout as the home side rarely threatened and fully deserved their win.With Toni Kroos and Luka Modric starting on the bench after returning from injury, Real struggled to control the midfield but PSG did not threaten in a dull start to the game.Real had a great opportunity in the 20th minute, but PSG goalkeeper Alphonse Areola pulled off a superb save as he parried Sergio Ramos`s effort from close range.The visitors had another chance in the 38th when Karim Benzema`s curled shot was saved by Areola. PSG had their first big chance on the stroke of halftime as Kylian Mbappe burst down the right flank, only for his low shot to be blocked by Real keeper Keylor Navas.DANGEROUS REALThe stadium announcer asked the PSG fans to stop lighting flares at the start of the second half, with smoke having covered part of the pitch.But that did not stop Real being the most dangerous side again, Ronaldo`s header from near the penalty spot shaving Areola`s right-hand post.The Portuguese was spot on in the 52nd minute, beating Areola with a downward header from Lucas Vazquez`s cross from the left.PSG coach Unai Emery, who is under pressure a year after his side lost 6-1 at Barca in the last 16 following a 4-0 home win in the first leg, replaced holding midfielder Thiago Motta with the more creative Javier Pastore on the hour.But PSG finished the match with 10 men after combative midfielder Verratti picked up a second yellow card. They levelled in the 71st when the ball deflected into the net off Cavani to give the home fans a glimmer of hope.However, that was short-lived as Casemiro`s shot in the 80th minute took a slight deflection off Marquinhos to earn the win as Real made the quarter-finals for the eighth straight season.', 'Washington: A US Navy veteran charged with the killing of Indian techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla and injuring two others at a suburban Kansas City bar last year, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to premeditated first-degree murder. Adam Purinton, 52, pleaded guilty before a Kansas court.He was charged with first-degree murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and two counts of attempted first-degree murder in the shootings of his friend, Alok Madasani, and a bystander, who chased Purinton after he fled the Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe city on February 22, last year.Puriton had pleaded not guilty on all these charges and waived his preliminary hearing in late November 2017.Kuchibhotla’s widow welcomed the guilty plea. “Today’s guilty verdict will not bring back my Srinu, but it will send a strong message that hate is never acceptable,” she said in a statement.According to court documents, Purinton’s plea hearing was originally scheduled for May 8 but later it was moved to March 6. Witnesses said Purinton yelled at the two Indian men to “get out of my country” before pulling the trigger.Federal prosecutors alleged that Purinton committed offences after substantial planning and premeditation, attempted to kill more than one person in a single criminal episode, and knowingly created a grave risk of death to others on the scene.Purinton faces a maximum penalty of death or life in prison. ', 'New Delhi: The sensational Manu Bhaker, all of 16, shot her way to a second successive gold medal in a mixed team event as India consolidated their position at the top in the ISSF World Cup in Guadalajara, Mexico.Partnering Om Prakash Mitharval, the Indian teenager clinched the 10m air pistol mixed team title, a day after she won the women’s 10m air pistol individual gold on what is turning out to be a memorable senior World Cup debut.The 11th standard student could be the youngest ever to win senior World Cup gold medals for India, though the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) could not confirm.Also, the duo of Deepak Kumar and Mehuli Ghosh won the country its sixth medal of the competition – a bronze in the 10m air rifle mixed team event.Deepak and Mehuli shot 435.1 in the five-team final, finishing behind the Romanian pair of Alin Moldoveanu and Laura-Georgeta Coman who shot 498.4 for silver. China’s Xu Hong and Chen Keduo won gold in a world record score of 502.0.But it was Bhaker, the girl from Jhajjar, Haryana, who stunned the shooting world with a second successive gold in as many days.For someone who took to shooting just a little over two years ago, winning two gold medals in a global event of this magnitude would easily qualify as some achievement.Shooting happened to her by chance after a brush with contact sports (boxing, martial arts) and Bhaker has already stamped her class in the tournaments she competed in.Asked about her penchant for winning medals with record-breaking feats, the unassuming pistol shooter said, “It just happens. I don’t think about them. At times I don’t even know what the records are.“I am grateful to all my coaches for their advice and the hours they have put in to hone my technique,” Manu added.Last December, she won the 10m air pistol event, outclassing the highly-experienced Heena Sidhu at the 61st National Shooting Championship in Thiruvananthapuram where she broke Heena’s long-standing national record.She won a staggering 15 medals, including nine gold, during the tournament.Bhaker’s tryst with shooting began when her father took her to the range and asked her to try her hand at the sport. She fired a few shots that found the centre of the target and the rest is history.On the third day of competitions in the Mexican city, once again both Indian entries in the 10m air pistol mixed team event made it through to the medal rounds.Bhaker and Om Prakash shot 770 in qualification to be placed second behind the German husband and wife pair of Christian and Sandra Reitz who shot 777 for a qualifications world record score.Mahima Agrawal and Shahzar Rizvi shot 763 to be positioned fourth and made it to the five-team final round from among the 16 competing teams.In the final, there were three pairs in contention from the very beginning – India’s Bhaker and Om Prakash, team Reitz of Germany and the French pair of Celine Goberville and Florian Fouquet.After a see-saw battle between the three, the Indian and the German pair pulled ahead of the French duo decisively after 38 shots, with the Germans ahead of the Indians.With the final six shots remaining, the Germans were ahead of the Indians by 0.1 but Bhaker and Om Prakash finished strong to clinch the battle after 48 shots, almost a point ahead of the Germans.The final scores in favour of the Indians read 476.1 to 475.2.Mahima Agrawal and Shahzar Rizvi finished fourth with a score of 372.4 in the finals.In the women’s trap, India’s Seema Tomar was the best finisher, shooting 111 in qualifying to end in 15th spot.Shreyasi Singh shot 106 to finish 22nd while Shagun Chowdhary shot 101 to be placed 26th.Also at the end of the first day of the qualification round in men’s trap, India’s Kynan Chenai shot 49 out of 50 to lie in sixth place. Zoravar Singh Sandhu shot 46 to lie 28th while Manavjit Singh Sandhu shot 42 to be in 47th place.India’s medal count stood at three gold and four bronze medals for a total of seven podium finishes.', 'London: Manchester United’s Nemanja Matic volleyed a stunning added-time winner as they fought back from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace 3-2 at Selhurst Park and climbed to second place in the Premier League on Monday.Palace, who have never beaten United in the Premier League, took the lead after 11 minutes when Andros Townsend ran onto Christian Benteke’s square ball and struck a left-foot shot that deflected off Victor Lindelof past goalkeeper David de Gea.The hosts went 2-0 in front three minutes into the second half when Jeffrey Schlupp took a quick free kick after a foul on Benteke and left-back Patrick van Aanholt raced at goal before firing past De Gea to put Palace in the driving seat.United pulled a goal back seven minutes later when the unmarked Chris Smalling headed in Antonio Valencia’s cross and equalised in the 76th when Alexis Sanchez’s effort came back off the bar and Romelu Lukaku turned two defenders to fire home.Matic then snatched the points when his volley from 25 metres curled away from diving keeper Wayne Hennessey into the top corner to put United back into second spot on 62 points, 16 behind Manchester City and left Palace in the relegation zone.“It was a nice goal,” said Matic. “I am happy for the team, not because I scored but because we won and picked up the three points. We showed character after going 2-0 down and they had the crowd behind them.“We are delighted to have turned it around. Every point matters and it’s so important to win games like this.”United’s win put them nine points ahead of fifth-placed champions Chelsea in the battle for the top four which brings a place in next season’s Champions League group stage.It also took Jose Mourinho’s team back above Liverpool, who are two points behind before the pair clash at Old Trafford on Saturday, with Tottenham Hotspur a further two points behind.With nine games left, Palace are third from bottom with 27 points but only a point outside the safety zone.RASPING DRIVEWhen Townsend struck the opening goal it was the first time Palace had led United in the Premier League and the home fans could hardly believe their eyes when their Dutch international Van Aanholt beat De Gea at his near post with a rasping drive.However, Palace’s second goal stung United into life and they were soon back in the match when Valencia clipped a cross to the far post where Smalling was lurking on his own to direct a header back across Hennessey’s goal into the far corner.The game was then an absorbing end-to-end battle as both sides attacked but United found the equaliser when Sanchez’s shot was deflected onto the bar and came back for Lukaku who managed to find some space inside the area and fired home.The game was still on a knife edge but United started to pile on the pressure and the almost inevitable breakthrough came when the ball fell to the visitors’ Serbia midfielder Matic who instinctively struck a superb shot into the top corner.It was the first time United had come from two goals down to win a Premier League game since December 2013 while Palace, who have failed to beat United in 18 Premier League meetings, had never lost in the competition with at least a two-goal lead.', 'Canberra: The island continent, Australia, which is nowhere on the map of China`s investment initiative – One Belt One Road (OBOR) – has suddenly found itself on the route, which, upon its completion, will take the global trade to the next level.According to a report published on the abc.net.au, the latest development has taken place after a theme park project, to be developed by Chinese firm Songcheng in Australia`s Gold Coast City, was found listed on China`s Ministry of Culture website late last week.The proposed Australian Legend World at Nerang suburb, worth more than $400 million, has been described as a “key cultural trade and investment project” and a part of the China`s ambitious OBOR initiative.“The Australian Government may not want to not sign up to the initiative as a program but there`s nothing to stop particular projects in Australia signing up on their own account,” the ABC quoted China expert John Fitzgerald as saying.On the ministry`s website, the proposed park has been listed at number 11 among 40 other top priority government projects, which are affiliated with the OBOR, scheduled to come up at various locations around the world.Further, the project has made the cut despite China scaling back its overseas real estate investments and announcing new corporate investment guidelines last year.The Songcheng`s spokesman in Australia, Roland Evans, said with the park`s listing on the ministry`s website, the Chinese government has indicated that the proposal was in accordance with the new rules.Though the project may symbolise a new peak in the bilateral relations, the park is facing stiff opposition from the locals. Over 300 objections have reportedly been lodged with the Gold Coast City Council against the project.The locals have cited environmental and immigration concerns. However, Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate, according to the news network, has been quite enthusiastic about the project.“We`re delighted the Chinese Government has included this project on their Belt and Road list,” Mr Tate reportedly said in a statement. But, despite all the hype around the proposed park, its fate remains in the balance as it is yet to get the green light from the council, which will vote on the matter later this year.', 'Paris: France plans to make 15 the age of sexual consent after a public outcry over two cases of sex involving 11-year-old girls, Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa said on Monday.After public consultations and the recommendation of a panel of experts, “the government has decided to set the age at 15,” Schiappa told AFP. The issue was brought to the fore after critics and lawmakers said French laws had allowed two men to escape rape charges when they were accused of sex with underage girls.Any sexual act by an adult with a child younger than 15 can be prosecuted as a sexual offence under current French law.But prosecutors hoping to charge an offender with rape must prove the sex was forced, a more complicated question when pre-teens are involved.In November, a 30-year-old man was acquitted of the rape of an 11-year-old girl after the court determined she had not been subjected to “constraint, threat, violence or surprise”.In another case involving an 11-year-old girl, a 28-year-old man had faced charges of sexual relations with a minor, rather than rape — a decision that enraged the girl’s family.But last month the court reversed course and said the man should indeed face rape charges, though it asked for the trial to be moved to a higher court.Since then lawmakers and child-protection groups have been urging the government to set a minimum age of consent, as is the case in many European countries, with suggested ages ranging from 13 to 15.Schiappa said she was “very glad” that the government had chosen 15, as recommended by a panel of doctors and legal experts, an age long sought by associations fighting violence against children.The new age limit, part of a package of laws aimed at curbing sexual violence and sexism, is to be approved by the government in the coming weeks.', 'Washington/ New Delhi: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Saudi Arabia had granted Air India permission to fly over its territory on its new routes to and from Tel Aviv.There was no immediate confirmation from either Saudi officials or Air India. Netanyahu made the announcement during a briefing in Washington to Israeli reporters after he had met US President Donald Trump. Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel and lifting the 70-year-old airspace ban would reflect what appears to be thawing ties between Israel and the kingdom, both US allies with a shared concern over Iranian influence in the region.Last month, Air India announced the planned thrice-weekly flights to Tel Aviv over Saudi soil, but the General Authority of Civil Aviation in Riyadh said at the time it had not granted such permission to the carrier.El Al Israel Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, flies four weekly flights to Mumbai. These take seven hours as they fly south toward Ethiopia and then east to India, avoiding Saudi airspace. Israel media have said that Saudi overflight routes could reduce travel time by more than two hours.', 'Security forces on Monday gunned down Sunjwan attack mastermind and Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist Mufti Waqas in an encounter in Awantipora area of south Kashmir. Acting on intelligence input, a team of Army along with elite SOG cordoned off the Hatiwara area in Awantipora to attack a house when the terrorist was hiding.Mastermind of the Sunjwan attack, wherein at least five soldiers were martyred, Waqas had infiltrated into the Valley in 2017 from Pakistan to work in Jammu and Kashmir as the operational commander of JeM.The death of his encounter was confirmed on microblogging site Twitter by Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police SP Vaid. He tweeted, “Jaish commander Mufti Vakas has been killed in an encounter at Hatiwara Awantipora. He was Cheif Commander of JEM in J&K & master mind of suicidal attacks of Sunjuwan , Lethpora , Pulwama DPL and BSF at Srinagar airport.”Sujwan attack by JeM on an 36 brigade of Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry was carried out in the wee hours of February 10. As many as five soldiers were martyred during the operation that went on for hours. The security forces had killed three terrorists in the attack.Pakistan had denied its role in the audacious attack, saying the Indian officials and its media were making “irresponsible” statements even before conducting a proper investigation into the incident.Reacting to the issue, Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson accused India of running a “smear campaign against Islamabad and the deliberate creation of war hysteria.”“It is a well-established pattern that Indian officials begin making irresponsible statements and levelling unfounded allegations, even before a proper investigation into any incident has been initiated,” the Foreign Office spokesperson had said when asked about the attack on Sunjwan Army camp in Jammu.“A particular segment in the Indian media runs with their innuendos to malign Pakistan and whips up public frenzy. We are confident that the world community would take due cognisance of India’s smear campaign against Pakistan, and the deliberate creation of war hysteria,” he had said.', 'Mumbai: The Mohammed Shami-Hasin Jahan continues to get murkier as the Indian cricket team’s speedster’s wife has now claimed that he had relations with women from Pakistan and Dubai.In what came as an absolute shock, Jahan, on Wednesday took to her Facebook to claim that the Team India pacer has multiple extra-marital affairs. She also posted photos of women with whom Shami is apparently in relationship. Jahan also shared the photos of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger chats between Shami and his alleged girlfriends.While Shami took to his social media channels to deny the adultery charges, saying that it is nothing but an attempt to derail his cricket career, Shami was not included in the BCCI players’ contracts, which were announced on Wednesday evening. While one of the BCCI officials said that Shami’s name will be added if proven innocent, for now, the things look ominous for Shami.Jahan also said that while the rest of the Indian cricket team returned to India from South Africa, Shami checked in a Dubai hotel with a Pakistani woman on February 18 before returning to India the next day.“This has been going on for several months. I found this out on his way back from South Africa last month. He stayed at a hotel in Dubai while the rest of his teammates returned to India. A chat revealed that he was scheduled to meet a girl from Pakistan at the airport. He checked into a hotel on February 18 with the woman. He came back to India the next day,” Jahan told Times of India outside her Katjunagar apartment in Jadavpur.Jahan claimed that the cricketer was in relationships with women from Bangalore, Pune, Indore and Nagpur and had relations with women from Dubai and Pakistan. She also alleged that when she confronted him, he threatened her. “He regularly calls these women to his hotel rooms whenever he is visiting these cities. He also has relations with women in Pakistan and Dubai. I confronted him but he threatened me and dared me to do whatever I wanted,” Jahan said.Jahan also claimed that Shami beat her on his return from the recently-concluded South Africa tour. She also stated that cricketer’s mother and brother tortured her and tried to kill her.', 'New Delhi: In a dramatic twist in the ongoing PNB-Nirav Modi scam tale, it has now been revealed that the Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association had forewarned the RBI governor of the time — Raghuram Rajan — of an epic swindle in the works as far back as July 26, 2014.According to IBJA president Mohit Kamboj, “Finance minister P. Chidambaram ostensibly brought the 20:80 gold policy at that time to control the burgeoning current account deficit which had shot into the stratosphere due to rampant gold import. In this policy the jewellers had to export 20 per cent of the gold that they got from banks. In reality, this was done by the finance minister to benefit a handful of cronies going under the nomenclature of Star Trading Houses and Premier Trading Houses (which included both Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi groups) since scarce gold was sold at a mark up of approximately 10 to 15 per cent per kg.” “We made several representations not just to the RBI governor but to finance ministry mandarins including P. Chidambaram himself but all to no avail. It is only in July 2014 after the NDA government had come to power was cognisance taken of the clutch of continuing representations and FM Arun Jaitley acted and clamped down in November on this dubious and even suspicious scheme,” he claimed.In his capacity as IBJA president, he wrote to RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on July 26, 2014 accusing the UPA government of “deliberately yielding to the cronies” By changing the gold policy days before demitting office. A decision was taken on May 21, 2014, five days before the UPA government officially demitted office, which allowed 13 ‘Star Trading Houses (STH)’ and ‘Premier Trading Houses (PTH)’ including Choksi-led Gitanjali Gems to import gold and sell about 80 per cent of their total bullion shipment in local markets under the so-called 80:20 scheme.IBJA said that the RBI circular on May 21, 2014 had “sidestepped nationalised banks, which have been the backbone support of our bullion importing and jewellery exporting members, by allowing certain private sector export houses to import gold up to two tonnes at one time, even for those who are not in the business of bullion and gold jewellery”. Further, the association also asked Dr Rajan to “make a prudent appraisal” of the decision and “check the loopholes before it was too late.”', 'Amaravati: Two BJP legislators from Andhra Pradesh will quit from state cabinet on Thursday, hours after Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu asked his ministers to resign from the Union Cabinet over Centre’s refusal to grant special status to the southern state.BJP MLA Akula Satyanarayana announced on Wednesday that the two BJP ministers in the state cabinet – Kamineni Srinivas and Paidikondala Manikyala Rao – will resign on Thursday morning.He said both Srinivas and Manikyala Rao would not attend the cabinet meeting to be held on Thursday morning.Echoing a similar sentiment, BJP leader Krishna Sagar Rao called Naidu’s announcement a ‘political opportunism’.“BJP believes what has happened tonight is a classic case of political opportunism and a case of compulsive politics,” Rao said.He also called Naidu’s statement that the central government was not standing up to support Andhra Pradesh, “a blatant lie”.The fast-paced developments took place after the N Chandrababu Naidu-led party announced its decision to pull out of the Centre over its refusal to grant Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh.TDP chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu had announced on Wednesday that the two TDP ministers – P Ashok Gajapathi Raju (Civil Aviation) and YS Chowdary (Minister of State for Science and Technology) – will tender their resignations on Thursday.Addressing a press briefing, Naidu alleged that the Centre has done huge injustice to the state.The TDP is the second-largest party after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In the Lok Sabha, the TDP has 16 members and six in the Rajya Sabha.It is the first pre-poll partner of the BJP to pull out of the Modi government after being part of it for nearly four years. His announcement came hours after Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in New Delhi told the media that granting of special status to Andhra Pradesh was not possible after the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. Jaitley did not make any new commitment except for reiterating that the Centre had extended all possible help to the bifurcated state.Granting special category status was a promise made by the previous UPA government at the time of bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and creation of Telangana, which all the parties in the state are seeking now. Naidu said a decision on TDP’s continuation in the NDA would be decided after talking party-to-party (BJP and TDP). “This (quitting the cabinet) is the first step,” he said.“They (the Centre) are predetermined not to help the state. In the interest of our state, we have taken the decision,” he said. I tried to inform the PM for courtesy’s sake. But, he did not come online. My OSD informed the PM’s OSD.”The drastic decision of the TDP may not have come as a shock to the BJP, which had earlier conveyed to its two ministers in the Andhra Pradesh cabinet to be ready to quit any moment.Accordingly, Dr Kamineni Srinivas (Medical and Health) and P Manikyala Rao (Endowments) will quit the Naidu cabinet on Thursday, hours before the budget presentation by Finance Minister Y Ramakrishnudu in the state assembly. Naidu earlier held consultations with the party’s MPs, ministers and important leaders before taking the decision and making it public. The MPs, including the two ministers, expressed a unanimous opinion that Jaitley’s statement on the demands of Andhra Pradesh was ”disappointing and discouraging.” All parties in the state, including the ruling TDP and the main opposition YSR Congress Party, have been agitating in Delhi demanding grant of special status.Agitations are also going on across the state. Naidu said at the time of making the alliance, the BJP had said it backed the demand for grant of special category status for Andhra Pradesh but now it was singing a different tune. He said the promises on statehood and other financial demands of the state have not been honoured by the BJP and he could not make any compromise on the state’s interest. “TDP is not for power but for self-respect. We decided there is no point in continuing in the government,” he added.Naidu said Jaitley’s comments suggest that Andhra Pradesh is asking for too much.He also slammed the Finance Minister for saying “sentiments will not decide the quantum of funds”.He said he made 29 trips to Delhi, met the Prime Minister and other ministers and tried to do his best to do justice for the state. “I am not angry with anybody,” he added.

According to reports, an Air India flight no. AI 996 carrying Takla and CBI officials landed in Mumbai around 5.30 am today.Takla, who has been managing the operation of Dawood’s international crime syndicate in Dubai, is wanted in several cases, including murder, extortion and kidnapping for ransom.He will be produced before a special TADA court here.Taqla has fled India after the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai along with Dawood and his henchmen.He is a co-accused in the Mumbai blasts case along with Dawood and several of his close aides.Takla faces conspiracy charges in connection with the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case.  It is believed that National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval has played a pivotal role in Takla’s deportation to India.At India’s request, the Interpol had issued a Red Corner Notice against Takla in 1995.Takla’s arrest has tightened the noose around fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, who is believed to be hiding in Pakistan under the patronage of its spy agency ISI.The Government of India has also meanwhile expedited its efforts in getting Dawood Ibrahim back to India and given credible evidence to Pakistan to show that he is currently living there at a secret location.Well-known criminal lawyer Shyam Keswani had recently said fugitive mafia don Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar is reportedly “keen to return to India” but with certain preconditions which are not acceptable to the government.Speaking to the media outside the Thane Court, where he represented Iqbal Ibrahim Kaskar (the absconder don’s brother) in an extortion case, the lawyer said among the conditions Dawood has stipulated are that he should be lodged only in the high-secure precincts of Arthur Road Central Jail (ARCJ) in Mumbai.“He had also conveyed his intentions through (former union minister and eminent lawyer) Ram Jethmalani a few years ago but the Indian government has not entertained any of his preconditions to return,” Keswani said.The ARCJ is the same prison where the Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab was lodged for nearly four years till his hanging for his role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.(With Agency inputs)', 'Hyderabad: A case has been registered against a man who had allegedly sexually assaulted a 77-year-old woman at her residence in Mailardevpally area of Hyderabad and attempted to kill her.The accused has been identified as 22-year-old P Vamshi, a daily wage labourer, according to the Mailardevpally Police Station.

', 'NEW DELHI: In a huge win for Kerala ‘love-jihad’ victim Hadiya, the Supreme Court on Thursday set aside the Kerala High Court order which had annulled the validity of her marriage. The SC bench restored her marriage with her husband Shafin Jahan.Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court had asked the investigating agencies to continue their probe into whether there was any criminality but had asked them not to intrude in her marriage. Appearing for the NIA, lawyer Maninder Singh had submitted to the Supreme Court that the probe has almost been completed. It had said that it only needs to examine two more individuals, Fasal Musthafa and Shirin Shahand, who are material and crucial witnesses in the case.The NIA had earlier denied the allegations that it had behaved with Hadiya with a prejudice as if she is a criminal or a terrorist. The NIA asserted that it conducted the investigation in a “fair, objective and impartial manner” based upon evidence and material collected so far. It also denied the allegations that she was misled to portray her husband Shafin Jahan as a terrorist and that she was treated as a criminal, the agency said the allegations are “misconceived, entirely baseless, incorrect”.“The NIA has conducted the investigation in a fair, objective and impartial manner based upon the evidence/ material collected so far. There is no question of any personnel, who was entrusted with the investigation of the case, acting in a prejudicial manner, much less treating Hadiya as a criminal or a terrorist,” stated the affidavit filed by the NIA.Hadiya, in her affidavit before the top court, had earlier said that she converted to Islam and married Jahan on her own and wanted to remain like that. She had levelled allegations against her father and some NIA officials for being prejudiced.', 'Salem: A woman was arrested on the charges of murdering her son along with her paramour near here on Wednesday.  According to police, Mynavathi, 24, wife of powerloom unit worker Manikandan from S. Papparapatti near Attaiyampalayam, has two sons Sasikumar (7), and Akilan (3).

It also features women personnel handling ground operations of the Indian Air Force.The song titled ‘zameen se chalein hum aasmaan ke kareeb’ runs a little over 2 minutes and captures everything from women officers flying IAF aircraft to taking part in parades.This comes just days after flying officer Avani Chaturvedi created history by becoming the first Indian woman fighter to fly solo. She flew a MiG-21 Bison in her first training solo sortie in Jamnagar, Gujarat.She is one of the three in the first batch of female pilots, besides Bhawana Kanth and Mohana Singh, who were inducted in Indian Air Force fighter squadron on June 18, 2016. The IAF had termed it as a unique achievement for the force and the country.It was in October 2015 that the Government took the decision to open the fighter stream for women. Meanwhile, combat roles in the Army and the Navy are still off-limits for women, due to a combination of operational concerns and logistical constraints.On December 16, 2017 two women from the second batch to enter the fighter stream of the Indian Air Force were commissioned after graduating from the Air Force Academy, Dundigul.It was only in 1992 that the armed forces began recruiting women to streams, other than the Medical stream.', 'New Delhi: Superstar Salman Khan is known for standing by his friends in the film industry.

An area resident who requested anonymity, fearing reprisal attacks, said two mosques and some Muslim-owned shops were attacked Wednesday in two towns in the central hills. The extent of the damage could not be verified.Meanwhile, an internet company official says the government has ordered popular social media networks blocked across a swathe of central Sri Lanka in an attempt to stop the spread of religious violence.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity under company policy, said the networks, including Facebook, Instagram, Viber and WhatsApp, were blocked in the central hills, scene of the violence. Outside of that region, though, many people were also unable to access the social media sites.The government order came as anti-Muslim rioting flared anew, with Buddhist mobs attacking mosques and Muslim-owned shops in at least two towns.Anti-Muslim riots began Monday after a Buddhist Sinhalese man died after reportedly being attacked by a group of Muslim youths. Sri Lanka has long been divided between the majority Sinhalese, who are overwhelmingly Buddhist, and minority Tamils who are Hindu, Muslim and Christian.', 'Douma: Heavy air strikes and clashes shook the Syrian rebel enclave of Eastern Ghouta ahead of an urgent UN Security Council meeting Wednesday on the escalating violence.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 805 civilians including at least 178 children have been killed since Russia-backed regime forces launched an assault on the besieged enclave outside Damascus on February 18. Russia suffered its own heavy losses on Tuesday as the defence ministry said a Russian transport plane crash landed at an airbase in western Syria, killing all 39 people on board.Bombardment and clashes in Eastern Ghouta, the last major rebel stronghold near Damascus, have persisted despite a month-long ceasefire demanded by the Security Council more than a week ago.At least 24 civilians were killed on Tuesday, according to the Observatory, a Britain-based monitor.The relentless attacks prompted France and Britain to request an emergency meeting of the top UN body behind closed doors on Wednesday to discuss the ceasefire’s failure to take hold.Government troops have advanced rapidly across farmland in Eastern Ghouta in the past week and had wrested control of 40 percent of the enclave as of early Tuesday.In the enclave’s main town of Douma, air strikes have reduced homes to piles of rubble, an AFP correspondent reported.Exhausted civil defence workers on Tuesday took advantage of a few hours of calm to dislodge the body of a resident, killed in bombardment several days ago, from a collapsed building.Eastern Ghouta’s around 400,000 residents have lived under government siege since 2013, facing severe shortages of food and medicines even before the latest offensive began.Forty-six aid trucks entered the area on Monday for the first time since the offensive started, but had to cut short their deliveries and leave due to heavy bombardment.Nearly half of the food carried on the convoy could not be delivered and Syrian authorities removed some medical and health supplies from the trucks, the United Nations said.Also Read: In its strongest accusation, US alleges Russia of killing civilians in SyriaIn a statement on Tuesday UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he “calls on all parties to immediately allow safe and unimpeded access for further convoys to deliver critical supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in desperate need”.He urged all warring sides to allow aid trucks to return for a planned second delivery to Douma on Thursday.Rebels Fire MortarsCivilians in the area used the lull in air strikes to venture out from cellars to gather a few necessities from what was left of their homes.Some gathered the pieces of furniture smashed in the raids to use as fuel or sell to their neighbours.An AFP reporter in Hammuriyeh said air strikes were continuing to pummel the town on Tuesday.The raids came after around 18 people suffered breathing difficulties in the town following a strike there late Monday, the Observatory reported.It had no firm word on the cause.“The people we’ve met here have been through unimaginable things. They looked exhausted,” Pawel Krzysiek of the International Committee of the Red Cross said after the aid convoy ended its mission on Monday.The UN Human Rights Council on Monday ordered investigators to examine the latest violence in the enclave.It condemned “the indiscriminate use of heavy weapons and aerial bombardments against civilians, and the alleged use of chemical weapons in Eastern Ghouta”.The area is the last opposition bastion on the Syrian capital’s doorstep, and the regime is keen to retake it to secure Damascus.Also Read: Hell on Earth: 500 deaths later, UN calls for ceasefire amid E Ghouta massacreRebels there have fired waves of rockets and mortars onto eastern Damascus neighbourhoods.On Tuesday, three civilians were killed and eight wounded in mortar fire on the neighbourhood of Jarmana, according to state news agency SANA.‘Corridor’ Expanded To RebelsRegime ally Russia last week announced a five-hour daily “humanitarian pause” in the region, during which it said it would guarantee safe passage to civilians wishing to flee the enclave.No Syrian civilians are known to have used the “humanitarian corridor”.On Tuesday, Russia announced that the exit route had been expanded to allow rebels, not just civilians, to leave the enclave.Russia’s air force intervened in Syria in 2015 on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad, helping his troops retake key cities across the country.It has been repeatedly accused of hitting civilians, and UN investigators on Tuesday said a Russian strike on a crowded Syrian market in 2017 may amount to a “war crime”.The air strikes on a market in rebel-held Atareb in northern Syria last November 13 killed at least 84 people, including five children, and injured around 150 others, the UN Commission of Inquiry on human rights in Syria said in its latest report.Moscow’s defence ministry said on Tuesday that a Russian transport plane crashed on landing at the Hmeimim airbase, killing 33 passengers and six crew members all military personnel.“The reason for the crash according to preliminary information could have been a technical fault,” the ministry said, adding that the plane had not come under fire according to a report from the ground.More than 340,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in Syria since the start of the civil war in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.Over the years, numerous rounds of UN-backed Syria peace talks have failed to stem the fighting.In the latest attempt to end the seven-year war, the foreign ministers of regime allies Iran and Russia and rebel backer Turkey are to meet next week in Astana.', 'Keeping the pressure up on Pakistan for committing atrocities against locals in Balochistan, the Baloch Republican Party on Wednesday took their protest right up to the doors of the United Nations office in Geneva.Armed with Baloch flags and demanding freedom for Balochistan, the activists marched from Rive to the UN office in a protest held on the sidelines of the ongoing 37th UN Human Rights Council. It is reported that Baloch men, women and children from all walks of life joined to demand freedom from state-sponsored atrocities being committed back home. Interestingly, this is not the first time Balochi activists have made their presence felt in Switzerland.  It is hardly the first time they have made international headlines either.Posters splashed across buses and trams in Geneva in September last year showed the brutality of Pakistani establishment vis a vis Balochis.  Slamming the country for allegedly committing genocide, the posters both embarrassed and infuriated Pakistan. A possible diplomatic row was eventually averted despite Islamabad summoning Switzerland’s ambassador to register its strong protest. There has however been no let up in shame for Pakistan as more recently, ‘Plight of Christians in Pakistan’ posters appeared in Geneva in what was yet another attempt to showcase how the country treats minorities.The strong protests have not just been restricted to scenic Switzerland as London and New York have seen an advertisement blitzkrieg from organisations like Baloch Republic Party and more so from World Baloch Organisation (WBO). WBO, in particular, has been responsible for putting up posters and hoardings across the streets of London and New York – even booking an ad space at the iconic Times Square.The efforts of Baloch activists have repeatedly angered Pakistan but foreign countries have maintained they are helpless in doing anything about legitimately bought ad spaces. For instance, UK envoy in Islamabad had snubbed Pakistan last November and had said his government cannot control advertising. “I understand the strength of feeling about adverts in London. The British Government does not and cannot control advertising in the UK. But our own position is clear about the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan, of which Balochistan is and will continue to be an integral part,” British High Commissioner to Pakistan Thomas Drew had said.Other diplomats and envoys too have maintained similar position even as Baloch activists continue to raise the tempo of their protests.', 'New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take over the portfolio of Civil Aviation from Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju following his resignation on Thursday evening. “As advised by the Prime Minister, the President has directed that the work of the Ministry of Civil Aviation will be looked after by the Prime Minister,” news agency ANI quoted Rashtrapati Bhawan as saying. Two Union Ministers, Ashok Gajapathi Raju and YS Chowdary, have submitted their resignations to the Prime Minister on Thursday evening following the TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s announcement. Naidu on Wednesday said that two of his lawmakers will resign from their ministerial posts as the Centre has not considered their demand for special status for Andhra Pradesh. The resignations of Raju and Chowdary were accepted by President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday, as advised by the Prime Minister.', 'Patna: RJD supremo Lalu Prasad on Thursday attacked Nitish Kumar for not being able to secure the special category status for Bihar, accusing the chief minister of surrendering the interest of the state for personal gains. The RJD supremo, who has been in jail for more than two months following his conviction in fodder scam cases, made the attack on Twitter, which is managed by people close to Lalu Prasad.  He asked Nitish Kumar why he did not put enough pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to offer special status to Bihar. Lalu Prasad’s comments came in the backdrop of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) ministers resigning from the Union council of ministers over the demand for special status to Andhra Pradesh. “Why is Nitish not asking his boss to accord special status to Bihar. PM Modi had promised special status to Bihar in March, 2014 at a rally in Muzaffarpur during Lok Sabha elections. Nitish must play that speech recording in front of the PM,” a tweet on Lalu Prasad’s official Twitter handle said. He accused Nitish Kumar of having surrendered Bihar’s interest for personal gains – an oblique reference to the chief minister’s exit from the Grand Alliance and forming a new government in the state with the BJP. In another tweet, the former Bihar chief minister asked, “Why is Bihar not getting special status despite the NDA being in power both at the Centre and in the state? Does Nitish not want special status or is the BJP opposed to it?” He also asked Nitish Kumar to disclose why and because of whom Bihar is not getting its due. “Nitish ought to keep his spine straight and let go of his fear and his self-interest.” The RJD chief also sought to know how much of the Rs 1.65 lakh crore announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as special package has been given to the state. “Actually, the state has not got even a penny. Admit it, if you have the guts. How long will you keep hoodwinking the people,” the RJD supremo added.', 'Colombo: Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena Thursday replaced Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the law and order minister amidst fresh violence between majority Sinhala Buddhists and minority Muslims in the Kandy district despite imposition of nationwide emergency.Ranjith Madduma Bandara, a senior politician from Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP) was sworn in this morning as the new minister in charge of the police. Mr Wickremesinghe’s 11-day tenure as the law and order minister was marred by racial tension in the central district of Kandy since Monday.Muslim-owned businesses and religious sites came under attack from majority Sinhala mobs, forcing the government to enforce curfew.The Sri Lankan government Wednesday suspended internet services and blocked access to social networking websites and messaging platforms like WhatsApp in the riot-hit areas.Following the incidents of violence, President Sirisena on Tuesday declared a state of emergency and deployed police in the area.A daytime curfew was relaxed Thursday in Kandy where three people were killed in riots.“In accordance with the people’s request to remove the curfew for a short period to attend their essential activities including purchasing of food and other items, President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to remove the curfew from 10:00 am and re-impose at 6:00 pm in the Kandy district,” Director General of Government Information Sudarshana Gunawardhana said in a statement.The leader of the main Tamil party TNA R Sampanthan questioned the inaction of law enforcement authorities in response to the attacks on Muslim establishments.Speaking in parliament, Sampanthan, who is also the leader of the Opposition, said such incidents are clearly unacceptable and is indicative of sense of impunity.“People seem to have the confidence that they can engage in such acts and that the arm of the law would not reach them; that the Rule of Law would not be enforced against them,” Mr Sampanthan said.Kandy, the country’s second largest with a population of around 125,000, is an important religious centre for Buddhists, and is home to numerous monasteries and temple complexes.Sinhalese Buddhists make up about 75 per cent of the population in Kandy.The violence in Kandy reportedly triggered by an isolated incident on March 4, when a taxi carrying four Muslim men collided with a van driven by a young Buddhist man, according to local police.The Buddhist man was assaulted with an iron bar and succumbed to his injuries in hospital, police confirmed.The four Muslim men have since been arrested and remain in police custody.Tensions between Muslim groups and the majority Sinhalese Buddhist community in the country have escalated since the end of the civil war in May 2009.In 2014, violence directed against Muslim minority groups broke out in the southwestern town of Aluthgama, following a rally by hardline Buddhist nationalist monks, resulting in the death of at least three Muslims.', 'Islamabad: A Pakistani court on Thursday allowed the registration of Jamaatud Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed’s party — the Milli Muslim League. The Islamabad High Court ordered Election Commission of Pakistan to register the MML. Earlier, the ECP had declined to register the MML, citing Saeed’s alleged terror links. India and the United States hold Saeed responsible for the 26/11.After the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, the United Nations Security Council had banned the JuD. Saeed has now announced to contest this year’s elections under the MML banner.', 'London: British detectives were scrambling on Thursday to uncover who poisoned a Russian former double-agent and his daughter with a nerve agent, as doctors battled to save their lives and that of a policeman who also fell ill after coming to their aid. Sergei Skripal, 66, who moved to Britain in a 2010 spy swap, is in a critical condition in hospital along with his daughter Yulia after they collapsed on a ben-ch outside a shopping centre on Sunday.  The brazen poisoning in Salisbury is being linked with Russia by British politicians and the media, sparking an angry response in Moscow. On Thursday, British police confirmed for the first time that a nerve agent was used and that their probe was now an attempted murder investigation. “Sadly, in addition, a police officer, who was one of the first to attend the scene is now also in a serious condition in hospital,” Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley told reporters. Scientific tests by government experts have identified the specific nerve agent used “which will help identify the source”, he added, declining to reveal the exact substance. British media reports suggest the three victims are seriously ill. Britain’s Sky News, quoting sources, said all three victims are in a coma. The Times newspaper, quoting a senior unnamed British government official, said Skripal’s condition was thought to be particularly severe. “The feeling is that he is not going to make it out of this,” the source told the newspaper. “I think it could be more positive (for Yulia). They are hopeful that she might be able to pull through.” The paper added that the police officer’s condition was thought to be “less severe”. ', 'NEW DELHI: In a historic judgment, the Supreme Court on Friday allowed passive euthanasia, saying that human beings have the right to die with dignity. Permitting paasive euthanasia, the apex court said that it will be permissible with guidelines.The SC said that a person can decide when to give up the life support system and added that it has laid down guidelines on who would execute the will and how a nod for passive euthanasia would be granted by the medical board. It said that its guidelines and directives shall remain in force till a legislation is brought to deal with the issue. The order was passed by a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. The CJI said that other members of the five-judge Constitution bench have concurred on the guidelines and directives passed by it. It was observed in court that when a medical expert suggests that a person afflicted with a terminal disease has no hope for recovery, he should be given the right to refuse being put on life support system to not prolong the agony of the patient.The SC had in 2017 said that the right to die in peace could not be separated from Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution. An NGO Common Cause had moved the top court way back in 2005 seeking right to make a living will, authorising the withdrawal of life support system in the event of will makers reaching irreversible vegetative state.The central government had in the course of hearing of the matter by a five-judge Constitution Bench told the top court that passive euthanasia was the law of the land with safeguards by virtue of an earlier 2014 judgement of the top court in Aruna Shanbaug case.The top court by its order on March 7, 2014, in Aruna Shanbaug case had permitted passive euthanasia under certain circumstances, provided it was backed by the permission of the high court.The Centre had also told the Constitution Bench that a draft bill permitting passive euthanasia with necessary safeguards was already before it for consideration. However, the Centre had opposed permitting a living will both on the grounds of “principle and practicality” as it expressed apprehension of its possible misuse.A living will is made by a person in his normal state of mind that is to be executed in the event of a terminal illness if he reaches an irreversible vegetative state.', 'NEW DELHI: As summer season approaches, the national capital is set to witness a power demand of 7000 megawatts (MW), highest so far. Delhi had witnessed an all-time peak demand of 6526 MW on June 6, 2017, at 15:31 hours.“Delhi government-owned State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) has worked out the anticipated power scenario for Summer months i.e. from April 2018 to September 2018 based on the historical trends.

A 1000 MW green power (solar and wind) will be procured to meet the requirements.The state has also identified key focus areas to prepare for the surge in electricity demand. These include network upgradation in problem areas, reduced outages and quick restoration, manpower management, and speedy resolution of consumer complaints.“In order to meet the increased anticipated demand the Transmission system capacity is augmented every year by DTL and DISCOMs prepare and execute their plans to establish a matching Sub-transmission and Distribution system,” said a release from Delhi government.“This year there is an addition of 1040 MVA in DTL system, a new 220 kV sub-station has been commissioned at Papankalan-III and another 220 kV sub-station at R. K. Puram shall be commissioned soon. Other than these, new Transformers/in-feeds have been added at Masjid Moth, Peeragarhi and Papankalan-I,” added the release.In 2017, the Power Department “ensured over 99 % power supply during peak summer months, meaning the power cuts merely .06% and this summer,” claimed Jain.

The BJP had decimated the CPI-M in Tripura – one of the last remaining Left bastions, ousting the party from power after 25 long years. While many criticised the incident, Ram Madhav says it was incorrect to term it as vandalism. “No statue has been broken in Tripura. This is false information. Some people had put a statue on a private land and then removed it. It is not vandalism,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Madhav also returned fire at those who criticised BJP and RSS for the incident in Tripura – especially West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who had said global leaders must be respected. “Vandalism is happening in West Bengal,” accused Ram Madhav. “Mamata ji should worry about her state first before worrying about what is happening in the rest of the country.”Tripura mein koi murti todhi nahi gayi hai.Yeh dushprachar ho raha hai.Ek private property mein, jinhone murti lagayi unhone hatayi hai.Vandalism nahi hua hai.Vandalism Bengal mein ho raha hai.Mamata ji apne rajya ki chinta karein, desh ki chinta baad mein karein: Ram Madhav, BJP pic.twitter.com/QVSn3tFZcT— ANI (@ANI) March 9, 2018Nonetheless, incidents of statue vandalism has seen a spike in recent days with icons like Periyar, Dr BR Ambedkar and even Mahatma Gandhi being targeted.

But I struck upon an exciting idea and felt if I turn it into a story then it’d suit Chaitanya. So I went and pitched the idea, and Chaitanya really liked it. I also suggested that it’d be nice to have Samantha be part of this story, and he asked me to go and pitch the story to her. She got really excited after she heard the story.”He added that he is figuring out shoot dates as Chaitanya is currently busy with two projects.“Chai is on the verge of completing Savyasachi and he also has Maruthi’s next.

S. Shakunthala. According to sources, the probe over a month was based on the missing woman, and a team even went to Mumbai to trace her after her relatives expressed doubt that she had gone there. What provided a breakthrough was the recovery of a 6.5 cm malleolar screw from the skeleton. A probe found only six persons had availed of the treatment for leg fracture using the screw from a hospital in Tripunithura. Though the cops managed to trace five others, the woman was missing. “The forensic experts had confirmed the skeleton to be that of a woman. We then conducted a DNA test using blood samples collected from her daughter Aswati. The report of the test conducted at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Thiruvananthapuram, has come out and is reportedly matching with the skeleton. The report will be sent to us officially by Friday only,” a senior officer said. The second phase of the investigation will now cover factors leading to her murder and the killer. The special investigation team suspects a man who committed suicide at Eroor on January 9, a day after the skeleton was recovered.\\n“The woman was living alone after her son committed suicide. She also was not in talking terms with her daughter after she got a divorce. She  had received a good amount of money from the sale of land she owned in Perumbavoor. As  per her daughter’s statement, the man who  committed suicide was a close family friend.  However, nothing is  conclusive now, and the probe is progressing,” the officer said. The barrel was found on the bank of Vembanad Lake. Only the skeleton, some hair strands and bits and pieces of clothes were found.', 'New Delhi: The Reserve Bank may provide four quarters to Punjab National Bank (PNB) for making provisions against the country’s biggest ever banking fraud of Rs 12,646 crore allegedly masterminded by billionaire diamantaire Nirav Modi.The bank has written a letter to the banking sector regulator seeking its opinion on making provisions for the fraud, sources said. Although there is a direction of the RBI on provisioning to be made in case of loan fraud, the bank is taking pre-emptive action to deal with extraordinary situation created by unearthing of this mega fraud.There is no precedence of fraudulent Letter of Undertaking (LoUs) issued earlier, so the RBI is likely to allow PNB to make provision against the fraud not exceeding over four quarters.Last month, PNB had lodged an FIR with CBI stating that fraudulent LoUs worth Rs 280.7 crore were first issued on January 16 this year. At the time, PNB had said it was digging into records to examine the magnitude of the fraud.In the complaint, PNB had named three diamond firms — Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds — saying they had approached it on January 16 with a request for buyers’ credit for making payment to overseas suppliers. The bank sought 100 per cent cash margins for issuing LoUs for raising buyers’ credit, which was contested by the firms saying they had availed of the facility from as early as 2010.Nirav Modi, his wife Ami, brother Nishal and Mehul Choksi are partners in Diamonds R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds, which has shops in foreign locations such as Hong Kong, Dubai, and New York.Among those named is a deputy manager, Gokulnath Shetty, who was posted at PNB’s foreign exchange department in Mumbai since March 31, 2010. He had allegedly along with another official Manoj Kharat fraudulently issued LoUs to these firms without following prescribed procedure or making entries in the banking system, avoiding detection of transactions.In 2015, Bank of Baroda — another public sector bank — had brought to light a scam in which two Delhi-based businessmen cheated it of Rs 6,000 crore (slightly less than USD 1 billion at that time).Investigations revealed major irregularities, as the forex transactions were done mainly via advance remittances for import, through newly-opened current accounts. Heavy cash transactions — sometimes four or five times a day — were also noticed.The Enforcement Directorate, under the revenue department of the finance ministry, had arrested the businessman duo under money laundering provisions.On Wednesday, the CBI has registered a fresh case against billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi in connection with the alleged fraud in credit facilities extended by Punjab National Bank, causing a loss of Rs 321 crore to it.The action has been taken on a complaint by the bank on March 4, they said.The CBI has named Modi, then president (finance) of his Firestar Diamonds International Limited Vipul Ambani, chief finance officer Ravi Gupta, other directors and officials of the company, and unidentified public servants of the bank, they said. This is the second CBI FIR in which Modi has been named.', 'Ferrari boss Sergio Marchionne has confirmed that the carmaker’s first production series hybrid will launch in 18 months’ time. Marchione also said that Ferrari already has hybrid test mules running, which feature a V8 hybrid powertrain.It will need to be a “traditional hybrid to fulfil its role”, in comparison to the LaFerrari’s kinetic energy recovery set-up, which was used as “an add-on” – essentially, it needs to give performance benefits rather than efficiency gains.It’s not yet been made clear which model will be outfitted with the hybrid powertrain. The timing, though, would suggest it could very well be Ferrari’s much-hyped forthcoming SUV, which is rumoured to be due next year.Marchionne said that Ferrari’s hybrid offering will ensure it can adhere to the upcoming European Union CO2 emissions targets for 2021. “We’re going to embrace electrification and make it a mainstay,” he said. The Ferrari boss also noted that the automaker was currently exempt from CO2 targets because it makes fewer than 10,000 cars but, “Once we have more than that, it will be an issue,” he said. “But I think with the hybrids, we will be fine.”The car is most likely to adopt a plug-in hybrid system to limit the amount of pure electric driving and lower CO2 emissions to achieve those targets. Such a model will directly rival Lamborghini’s Urus plug-in hybrid, which will arrive before the turn of the decade.There were no further details on power or efficiency, but when asked if a hybrid powertrain meant loss of character versus a V12, Marchionne said, “Have you driven a Ferrari hybrid? When you do, I’m sure you won’t miss a V12.”Marchionne also confirmed there will still be internal combustion-engined cars in future that sit alongside a growing number of hybrid models.', 'New Delhi: The official trailer of the biopic based on the life and times of Subedar Joginder Singh has been released.

And now we hear that filmmaker made the lead actor Varun Dhawan undergo some rigorous drills during the making to perform his part with sincerity. A report in DNA has claimed that Varun was asked to not sleep for an entire week, to be able to look a certain way for his character in the film.Shoojit is known for maintaining authenticity in his films. For some scenes in the movie, he wanted Varun to look as natural as possible and not use any makeup. Hence he told the young actor to not sleep for few days or have a maximum of 1-2 hours of sleep, in order to attain the look. Confirming the report, Shoojit told media, “Yes I usually do this with many of my actors, used this during PINK as well. A couple of scenes with Varun required extensive emotional burst-outs, a performance that showed him quite exhausted. Depth and weight in his overall demeanour and eyes, coupled with a tired voice, so I asked him to not sleep at night prior to the scenes.”‘October’ also stars Banita Sandhu as the female lead and is expected to be an unusual love story.

Previously on Wednesday, in a series of posts on Facebook and WhatsApp chats, Jahan accused Shami of cheating on her.She also alleged that the Bengal pacer took money from a Pakistani woman by the name of Alishba under the influence of England-based businessman Mohammed Bhai. “If Mohammed Shami can cheat me then he can cheat the country as well. He accepted money from a Pakistani girl named Alisbah in Dubai. He agreed to accept it after the insistence of England-based Mohammed Bhai. I have proof,” she was quoted saying to ABP.The cricketer on Thursday dismissed all the allegation against him and lashed out at his wife saying that she has “lost her mental balance”.“She has lost her mental stability.

I don’t know what she is up to. She needs to explain what has changed so much in these few days. She is suddenly leveling all these accusations on me. She is accusing of harassment.

A meeting between Kim and Trump, who have exchanged bellicose insults in the past year that have raised fear of war, would mark a dramatic breakthrough in efforts to resolve the tense standoff over North Korea’s effort to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland.“I told him (Trump) in our meeting that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said that he’s committed to denuclearisation,” Chung said. “Kim pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests.”“He expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,” he said. “President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong Un by May to achieve denuclearisation.”There was no immediate comment from the White House on the South Korean envoy’s comments.Trump’s aides have been wary of North Korea’s diplomatic overtures because of its history of reneging on international commitments.Chung and National Intelligence Service chief Suh-hoon flew to Washington earlier on Thursday to explain North Korea’s stance on possible future talks with Washington and the prospect of Pyongyang suspending nuclear tests if the security of the North’s government is assured.Earlier Thursday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that though “talks about talks” might be possible with Pyongyang, denuclearisation negotiations were likely a long way off.', 'Neymar already regrets moving to Paris Saint-Germain and is seeking a shock return to Barcelona, according to reports in the Spanish media on Friday.In the same week that PSG crashed out of the Champions League, and only seven months after he joined the club for a world record 222 million euros ($264 million), Neymar’s future has become uncertain.Spanish sports newspaper Mundo Deportivo claims the Brazilian, recovering from surgery on a broken foot in Brazil, has made contact with Barca to ask how he can engineer a return.The article adds Neymar has explained he made a mistake in leaving the club, was wrong to want independence from Lionel Messi and has been disappointed by the standard of opposition in Ligue 1.Barca, however, is not the only club Neymar is reportedly targeting as a potential way out of PSG.Madrid-based newspaper AS reports Neymar´s father has met with Real Madrid, who are ready to pay 400million euros to sign the striker.Asked about the speculation on Friday, Real coach Zinedine Zidane said: “Neymar could play in all the clubs because he is very good, like many players.“I´m not going to talk about a player that is not mine. On the 400 million, they paid 220 million and when they bought me they paid 72.“It seemed crazy to me and 10 years later they are paying 220 million. It can be that in the next 10 years someone will pay 400m, or sooner, I do not know.”Mundo Deportivo concedes Neymar´s courting of Barcelona may even be a tactic to justify a move to Real, given the Catalan club are likely to reject any chance to re-sign the 26-year-old.Barcelona are still embroiled in a financial dispute over a bonus due to Neymar last summer, which the club cancelled when they believe it became clear he was moving to PSG.Neymar missed PSG`s last 16 loss to Real on Tuesday after undergoing surgery on a broken foot in Brazil last week.', 'Seoul: The Indian women’s hockey team produced an all-round performance to notch a 3-1 win over higher-ranked South Korea in the fourth match of a five-match series here on Friday.The victory for world no. 10 India saw them take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series with a match remaining to be played on Sunday.Two goals in the first quarter by Gurjit Kaur (2′) and Deepika (14′) put India in a commanding position while Poonam Rani’s field goal in the 47th minute secured the victory for the visitors as Mi Hyun Park (57′) scored a consolation goal for South Korea.The early stages of the match saw India put pressure on the South Korean defense to win themselves a penalty corner in only the 2nd minute, which was well-converted by Gurjit Kaur as she put the ball past goalkeeper Heabin Jung to give the visitors the lead.After going behind early, South Korea had the chance to equalise in the 4th minute but the penalty corner was shot wide while another PC in the 10th minute was saved by Indian goalkeeper Swati.On the other end of the pitch, India won themselves a PC in the 14th minute which was slotted home calmly by Deepika and put India in a commanding position at the end of the first quarter.The second quarter saw chances come begging for both the teams but neither could trouble the opposing goalkeeper as the teams fought for possession in the midfield.The two teams tried to get behind each other’s defense but neither could beat the defensive line or earn themselves a scoring opportunity as the defences for both the teams stood tall, meaning that India took a two-goal advantage into half-time.The penultimate quarter saw a similar story as the hosts were looking for a way back into the match, while the Indians were looking for a third goal to stamp their authority.It was only at the start of the fourth quarter when India produced a marvellous team move which was made up of some precise passing and clever skillful play as Vandana Katariya’s in-field pass was slotted into the back of the net by Poonam Rani in the 47th minute.The third goal put India in a strong position to wrap up a series win while the world no. 9 South Koreans looked dejected as they had little time to make a comeback into the match.However, the hosts showed some spirit in the closing stages which saw them score a consolation goal in the 57th minute through Mi Hyun Park. ', 'Seoul: A South Korean actor accused of sexual assault was found dead Friday, reports said, as a wave of #MeToo accusations sweeps the country’s still male-dominated society.Jo Min-ki, who had been accused of sexually molesting at least eight victims, was found dead at his home in Seoul, Yonhap news agency cited police as saying, adding suicide was suspected. Most of his victims were drama students at a provincial university where he taught, it said, adding the 52-year-old had been forced out of his professorship over the scandal, leaving his career in tatters.His roles were mainly in television series, but he also appeared in a number of films.The #MeToo movement has gradually gained ground in South Korea, which remains socially conservative and patriarchal in many respects despite its economic and technological advances.Allegations of abuse have been made against prominent men in fields ranging from politics to the arts.Earlier this week, provincial governor and former presidential contender Ahn Hee-jung resigned after an aide accused him of multiple rapes.The last straw came when Ahn called her into his office on the night of February 25 and apologised for having hurt her, talking about the country’s #MeToo movement, she told a television interviewer.“And then he raped me again,” she said, holding back tears.Ahn presented himself to prosecutors on Friday for questioning, apologising and saying he would cooperate with the investigation.It was a stunning fall — Ahn was the governor of South Chungcheong province and came second to current President Moon Jae-in in the contest for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2017.A governorship is seen as a springboard to a presidential bid and he had been tipped as a front-runner among liberal hopefuls to succeed Moon, who can only serve one term.“First of all, I offer my words of apology to the people and the provincial residents,” Ahn said outside the prosecutors’ office, as a barrage of flashbulbs went off.“I also feel deeply sorry for my wife and children,” he added, although he did not apologise to his accuser.', 'Washington: US President Donald Trump has agreed to a historic first meeting with Kim Jong Un in a stunning development in America’s high-stakes nuclear standoff with North Korea.Standing in front of the White House, South Korean National Secu-rity Advisor Chung Eui-yong announced the first ever meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader, which he said would take place by the end of May. Chung had recently returned from Pyongyang, where he met Kim who, he said, “expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible.” Mr Trump hailed “great progress” in the push to persuade Pyongyang to end its nuclear weapons program.“Meeting being planned!” he tweeted. “Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearisation with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time.” Great progress being made, but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached.” News of the summit, which South Korean President Moon Jae-in said was “like a miracle”, is the latest step in a quickening detente.North and South Korea exchanged envoys as Pyongyang sent a delegation to the South’s Winter Olympics, which Seoul had dubbed the “Peace Games”. The thaw came after a period of extreme tension between Washi-ngton and Pyongyang that sounded like the growing drumbeat of war. Just months ago, Trump mocked Kim by calling him “little rocket man”. Kim returned the favour by describing Trump as “mentally deranged” and a “dotard.” The US and North Korea were foes throughout the Cold War and fought on opposite sides of a bloody war in the 1950s. ', 'BENGALURU: The Bengaluru Magistrate Court granted a 5-day custody of main accused in journalist Gauri Lankesh’s murder, KT Naveen Kumar. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been given the custody for the probe. The 37-year-old had told the cops during interrogation that he paid Rs 1000 for each bullet for the murder which was sourced from Uttar Pradesh. Kumar, who hails from Birur town in Chikkamagaluru district, was arrested on February 18 by the SIT of Karnataka Police after he was identified with the help of CCTV footage.Lankesh was shot dead by unknown by assailants outside her residence in Bengaluru on September 5 last year. She was the editor of the Gauri Lankesh Patrike, a tabloid known for “anti-establishment” views.The sensational murder of the journalist had sparked an outrage across the country and triggered several protests across the country and especially in prominent parts of Karnataka.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had termed the killing of Gauri Lankesh “an onslaught on humanity” and said that his government would ensure that the culprits were brought to justice.The government is “honest” in its efforts to find those behind the killing and bring them to justice, Siddaramaiah had told the Legislative Assembly. “It is a cruel death… It is an onslaught on humanity,” Siddaramaiah said during the obituary reference to Lankesh in the House.“We have still not been able to nab those who killed her. A SIT has been formed to nab them,” he said.Informing the Assembly that killers of rationalist MM Kalburgi were also yet to be found, the CM said, “The government and investigating team are honest in their efforts to nab the culprits.”The Karnataka government later formed a 21-member SIT, led by Inspector General of Police B K Singh, to investigate the case.', 'New Delhi: The government has decided to provide full pension pay to armed forces personnel killed or injured guarding India’s border with China. The decision comes eight months after the Doklam standoff which saw Indian Army and PLA troops almost coming to physical blows.While families of soldiers were previously entitled to 30 per cent of the last emoluments, government officials have said that the ‘liberalised family pension’ allows for 100 per cent of the last-drawn emolument. This was previously applicable only for soldiers deployed along the international border with Pakistan. Security analysts and defence experts are underlining that extending it to Sino-India border is a sign of the government’s renewed focus towards not just tightening security but to also boost troop morale. However, the Army’s demand to implement the decision with retrospective pay from June of 2017 has been rejected.According to a defence ministry notification, the family pension scheme for the armed forces personnel deployed along the Sino-India border came into effect from March 7. It said the cases which were settled prior to the issue of the notification will not be “reopened”.Ties between the two countries along the border – especially around the Doklam area – remains frosty. Although troops of both sides had already withdrawn from the disputed Doklam territory, and although the Indian government has maintained that peace prevails, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently did reveal that there is a lot of construction activity on the Chinese side in the region. China also recently increased its defence budget significantly – alarming not just India but several other countries as well.', 'NEW DELHI: Traders and businessmen are likely to receive relief in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting, scheduled to be held on Saturday. The Council, chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is expected to extend the final deadline for filing of simplified sales return GSTR-3B by six months. Currently, the last date to file returns is March 31, 2018.The Council will also finalise the process for simplified return filing procedure for businesses registered under GST regime. The last date for filing initial GSTR-3B returns for a month is the 20th of the subsequent or next month.“The new return filing system, if agreed upon by the Council, would take about 3 months to be implemented. Till then GSTR-3B could continue,” an official told PTI.With a majority of businesses complaining of difficulty in filing returns, the GST Council asked Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi-led Group of Ministers (GoM) in January to work out a simplified return filing process so that businesses can fill up only a single form to file returns under GST.Simplified sales return GSTR-3B was introduced in July of last year, the month of GST roll out, to help businesses to file returns easily in the initial months of GST roll out. This was to be followed with filing of final returns — GSTR – 1, 2 and 3.“GSTR-3B filing system has stabilised and businesses are comfortable. So, businesses can continue to pay taxes by filing 3B till the time new return filing system is put in place,” the official added. The group of ministers met last month to work out a simplified return form, but the meeting remained inconclusive.In the GoM meet, the Centre and state officials presented their model for return simplification, while Nandan Nilekani also made his presentation. The idea is GST return form should be simplified, it should ideally be one return every month, Modi had said.About 8 crore GST returns have been filed so far on GST Network portal since the implementation of GST on July 1. In absence of anti-evasion measures and invoice matching, the GST collections have declined since July.As per official data available, in January 57.78 lakh GSTR-3B returns were filed, which fetched Rs 86,318 crore revenue to the exchequer.For December 56.30 lakh GSTR-3B were filed which fetched Rs 86,703 crore revenue to the exchequer, while in November 53.06 lakh returns were filed with total revenue of Rs 80,808 crore. Collections topped Rs 95,000 crore in the initial month of July.With PTI inputs', 'Washington: US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose “reciprocal tax” on countries like China and India if they do not match America’s tariff.Trump has, in recent days, spoken a number of times about the 50 percent duty that India levies on high-end motorbikes that Harley-Davidson, an American company, sells in India. He has repeatedly insisted that the US levies “zero” duty or “nothing” on motorbikes imported from India.“We’re going to be doing a reciprocal tax programme, at some point so that if China is going to charge us 25 percent or if India is going to charge us 75 percent and we charge them nothing,” he said as he imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminium from all countries except Canada and Mexico.“They are 50, they are 75 or they are 25, we are going to be doing the same numbers. It’s called reciprocal. It’s a mirror of tags. So they charge us 50, we would charge them 50,” Trump said.The US President said the stage for the imposition of reciprocal tax has been set in the first year of his administration.He said American companies had not been treated fairly by other countries.Referring to a tweet by Tesla chief Elan Musk, Trump said China charges 25 percent duty on American cars whereas it is just 2.5 percent on import of Chinese cars into the US.Trump said the “reciprocal tax” programme would ensure “fair trade deals” for the US.The US president mentioned China several times as he signed two proclamations to impose import duties on steel and aluminium.“China says it’s got two percent, but it sends much more. We’re going to have a great relationship, hopefully, with China, but we have to do something. We’re losing with China USD 500 billion a year. We have to do something,” Trump told reporters during the signing ceremony.Trump said the US is going to stop the trans-shipping. “Well, we’ll let it happen, but they’ve got to pay. So trans-shipping, frankly, is a big deal,” he said.“And they trans-ship, and we’re going to accept their product, but it’s going to cost a lot of money from the standpoint of the trans-shipper,” he added.The US, he said, is negotiating now with China.“We’re in the midst of a big negotiation. I don’t know that anything is going to come of it. They have been very helpful. President Xi (Jinping), I have great respect for. A lot of respect,” he said.“But we’re going to cut down the deficits one way or the other. We have a deficit with China of at least USD 500 billion. When you add an intellectual property, it’s much higher than that,” Trump said. ', 'False news stories spread much more quickly and widely on Twitter than truthful ones, an imbalance driven more by people than automated “bot” accounts, researchers said on March 8.A study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab examining about 126,000 stories shared by some 3 million people on Twitter from 2006 to 2017 found that false news was about 70 per cent more likely to be retweeted by people than true news. The study, published in the journal Science, was one of the most comprehensive efforts to date to assess the dynamics behind how false news circulates on social media.Twitter and other social media companies such as Facebook have been under scrutiny by US lawmakers and international regulators for doing too little to prevent the spread of false content. US officials have accused Russia of using social media to try to sow discord in the United States and interfere in the 2016 US presidential election.The stories examined in the study were reviewed by six independent fact-checking organizations including Snopes and Politifact to assess their veracity.False stories spread significantly more quickly and broadly than true stories in all categories of information, but this was more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends or financial information, the researchers said.They noted increases in false political stories during the 2012 and 2016 US presidential races. Though Twitter’s allowance of bots has come under particular criticism, the MIT researchers found these automated accounts accelerated true and false news equally, meaning people were more directly responsible for the spread of false news.MIT Media Lab researcher and study lead author Soroush Vosoughi said people may be more likely to share false news because it is more surprising, the same way that sensationalized “click bait” headlines garner more attention.“One reason false news might be more surprising is, it goes against people’s expectations of the world,” Vosoughi said in an interview. “If someone makes up a rumor that goes against what they expected, you are more likely to pass it forward.”While the study focused on Twitter, the researchers said their findings likely also would apply to other social media platforms including Facebook.A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment on the study’s findings, but pointed to tweets by company CEO Jack Dorsey last week pledging to “increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.”Twitter provided funding and some data access to support the study, which was published in the journal Science. The study’s findings faulting humans more than bots for sharing false news surprised the researchers, who said they next may look for ways to help people cut down on the sharing of false stories.“Let’s not take it as our destiny,” said Deb Roy, another of the researchers, “that we have entered into the post-truth world from which we will not emerge.”', 'Toronto: Humans are addicted to continuous social interaction, and not to their smartphone devices, a study of the dysfunctional use of smart technology has found.The findings, published in Frontiers in Psychology, suggest that smartphone addiction could be hyper-social, not anti-social.“There is a lot of panic surrounding this topic. We’re trying to offer some good news and show that it is our desire for human interaction that is addictive – and there are fairly simple solutions to deal with this,” said Samuel Veissiere, from McGill University in Canada.We all know people who, seemingly incapable of living without the bright screen of their phone for more than a few minutes, are constantly texting and checking out what friends are up to on social media.These are examples of what many consider to be the antisocial behaviour brought on by smartphone addiction, a phenomenon that has garnered media attention in the past few months and led investors and consumers to demand that tech giants address this problem.Veissiere said that the desire to watch and monitor others – but also to be seen and monitored by others – runs deep in our evolutionary past.Humans evolved to be a uniquely social species and require constant input from others to seek a guide for culturally appropriate behaviour.This is also a way for them to find meaning, goals, and a sense of identity.Researchers reviewed current literature on dysfunctional use of smart technology through an evolutionary lens.They found that the most addictive smartphone functions all shared a common theme: they tap into the human desire to connect with other people.While smartphones harness a normal and healthy need for sociality, Veissiere agrees that the pace and scale of hyper-connectivity pushes the brain’s reward system to run on overdrive, which can lead to unhealthy addictions.Turning off push notifications and setting up appropriate times to check your phone can go a long way to regain control over smartphone addiction. Research suggests that workplace policies “that prohibit evening and weekend emails” are also important.“Rather than start regulating the tech companies or the use of these devices, we need to start having a conversation about the appropriate way to use smartphones,” said Veissiere.“Parents and teachers need to be made aware of how important this is,” he said.', 'New Delhi: Stating that “seniority is not the sole criterion, but seniority does matter” while allocating cases to judges, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court AP Shah has said it is “strange” that four of the top five judges of the Supreme Court, other than the Chief Justice of India (CJI) – Justice Dipak Misra, have been “curiously kept out of all constitutional matters”.Justice Shah was speaking in the context of CJI Justice Dipak Misra making public the assignment of cases in the Supreme Court for the first time after he was publicly criticised by four judges (Justices Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, MB Lokur and Kurian Joseph) who are seniormost after Justice Misra. At a first-of-its-kind press conference held on January 12, the four senior Supreme Court justices had voiced their criticism of how major cases were assigned by the Chief Justice.“In the roster made public, we see that all four judges who made this public declaration are kept out of all important matters, be it the Ayodhya case, the Aadhaar matter or the land acquisition row.  While it is true that seniority is not the sole criterion, but seniority does matter,” said Justice Shah, delivering the BG Verghese Memorial Lecture on the topic “Chief Justice: First Among Equals” in New Delhi.According to the roster that was made public, the Chief Justice will hear all Public Interest Litigations and cases related to elections, criminal cases, social justice and appointment of constitutional functionaries.Justice Shah said, “In the present scenario, in the roster made public, we see that all four judges who made this public declaration are kept out of all important matters, be it the Ayodhya case, the Aadhaar matter, or the land acquisition row. While it is true that seniority is not the sole criterion, but seniority does matter.”“The fact that all four of the top five judges of the Supreme Court, other than the Chief Justice, have been curiously kept out of all constitutional matters, is surely strange and something to be questioned,” said Justice Shah. About the press conference by the four senior Supreme Court judges, Justice Shah further said, “I believe that the four senior judges of Supreme Court felt so troubled by the goings on in the judiciary and the Supreme Court in particular over the past few months that they felt driven to go public, for otherwise, they would be in transgression of their constitutional duties. In my mind there was no doubt as to the intentions behind the press conference. All four of the judges risked something or the other in being a part of this public conference.” Justice Shah called for judicial reforms, asking why the Right to Information Act has not applied to the judiciary.“For many decades, the judiciary has hidden behind a mask of constitutionalism, defending its silence as an intrinsic feature of its institutional integrity and role as a constitutional authority. But such a display of silence and integrity comes up short when it is at the cost of the rule of law, and principles of transparency and accountability,” said Justice Shah.Talking about the need of reform in judicial system, Justice Shah said, “I believe the Indian judiciary has much to learn from many places – from other courts of the world, or even from within the Indian judicial system itself. Whether it is developing a strong culture of trust and consultation like the English, or building a clear, transparent, seniority- and rule-based system of allocation like the Europeans, or avoiding the ad hoc-ism of Russia, we have a lot to learn and adopt and evolve for ourselves.”', 'Geneva [Switzerland]: India on Friday lashed out at Pakistan for playing the victim card after providing safe haven to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and UN-designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed. “It is extraordinary that the state which protected Osama Bin Laden and sheltered Mullah Omar should have the gumption to play the victim,” said India’s Second Secretary Mini Devi Kumam while responding to Pakistan’s accusations of human rights violations at 37th session of UN Human Rights Council. “In gross violation of UN Security Council resolution 1267, the UN designated terrorists like Hafiz Mohammed Saeed are freely operating with State support, and the UN designated entities are being politically mainstreamed in Pakistan,” added Kumam.Saeed, the mastermind of 2008 Mumbai attacks, is the founder of banned terrorists organisation Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa. Following his release from house arrest by a Pakistan court last year, there was widespread global outcry. Saeed went on to launch his political party, and announced his decision to contest polls in Pakistan.Asserting that Pakistan continues to support cross-border terrorism in India, Kumam added, “Even as terrorists thrive in Pakistan and roam its streets with impunity, we have heard it lecture about the protection of human rights in India. The world does not need lessons on democracy and human rights from a country whose own situation is charitably described as a failed state.”“They are raising funds in flagrant violations of Pakistan’s international obligations,” she added.“We await credible action by the Government of Pakistan to bring all those involved in the 2008 Mumbai attack and the 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks to justice,” she said.Kumam also demanded that Pakistan should end forced conversions and marriages of minorities; including Hindu, Sikh and Christian women, and prosecute all such cases.India also highlighted enforced disappearances and unlawful killing of political dissidents by the Pakistani security forces.“We urge the Council to call on Pakistan to stop targeting political dissidents and legitimate criticism in Sindh, Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and to stop torture, enforced disappearances and unlawful killing, including that of journalists and activists by its security agencies. Pakistan should also prosecute all perpetrators of such crimes,” Kumam said.India also demanded the end of sectarian violence, systemic persecution and attacks on Muslim minorities, such as Shia, Ahmadiyas, Ismailia and Hazaras in Pakistan.

However, while screens are getting bigger, living rooms remain the same,” Das told the gathering.“Our QLED technology makes it possible to give consumers a detailed experience in the same space even on super large screens,” he added.In 2017, the QLED series witnessed an overwhelming pre-booking response in India within a month of the launch, and the surprising trend was that 40 per cent of these bookings came from non-metros, the company said.Samsung is growing aggressively with an increased focus on tier-II cities in the country.For 12 years, the South Korean giant has been the global leader in the TV industry.In 2017, Samsung revolutionised the TV viewing experience with world’s most advanced QLED technology and captured imagination with “The FRAME” — a customisable TV that can blend into any room like a photo frame hanging on the wall.QLED TVs come with four global first innovations.They achieve 100 per cent colour volume, has the HDR 2000 functionality that brings out hidden details, sports an almost “invisible” cable and “One Remote Control” that offers an intuitive experience.In addition, Samsung’s latest “Smart View App” allows users to seamlessly share content from their smartphone to the TV.With the in-built intelligence platform “Bixby,” you can use voice commands to ask for your favourite movies or songs.', 'Bengaluru: The BJP’s Karnataka unit on Friday accused the Congress government in the state of “failure” on the law and order front and demanded that the Governor recommend imposition of President’s rule in the state.The state BJP chief Yeddyurappa also hit out at Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for allegedly instructing prison officials to provide “special amenities” to deposed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala who is lodged in the central jail here in connection with a disproportionate assets case. Slamming the government for the attack on Lokayukta P Vishwanatha Shetty, who was stabbed multiple times in his cabin on Wednesday, Yeddyurappa said, “this shows that there is no civilian government in place in the state.”He said the attack on the Lokayukta has become nationwide news and brought down the credibility of the state government in front of the world.“The government that cannot provide security to the honourable judge is not fit to continue in power even for a minute. Governor has to immediately take action and should recommend President’s rule,” he told reporters in Bengaluru.The former chief minister also said he along with Union Minister Ananth Kumar had met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Thursday on the matter.Alleging that day-by-day, the law and order situation has deteriorated, Yeddyurappa said Karnataka has, for the first time in its history, become “a goonda state”, where murders and extortion have become common.Giving numbers indicating increase in cases of murder, atrocities against Dalits, incidents of rape and dacoity, he said, “This is Siddaramaiah government’s record…the Chief Minister has to give an explanation to the people of the state.”Yeddyurappa targeted the government for repeated incidents of “attacks and murders” of BJP and right wing activists.He also accused the Siddaramaiah government of weakening the institution of Lokayukta by bringing in the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which works according to its instructions, to target political opponents.Referring to the allegation made by former DGP Prisons Sathyanarayana Rao that certain amenities were provided to Sasikala in jail following instructions from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Yeddyurappa called it “shameful”.“This for the first time in the history of the country, a Chief Minister has tried to help an inmate (in jail). This is an insult to our democratic system,” said Yeddyurappa.Terming it contempt of court, he said the governor has to initiate legal action against the Chief Minister.Siddaramaiah, however, has denied having instructed officials to give certain amenities to Sasikala.', 'New Delhi: Casual and social smoking is on the rise among young working women across metropolitan cities in India, an Assocham report said on Thursday.“Of the total (respondents), only about two percent said they were heavy smokers (smoking one pack a day or more)… a majority of them said that peer pressure and work-related stress pushed them to increase the number of cigarettes they smoked,” the report said. “Some (respondents) even said they smoked for weight loss,” it added.Almost all the respondents said that the phenomenon of women smoking was basically confined to tier-one cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, according to the report.Some of the respondents said they smoked “casually owing to the ‘cool’ factor and…feelings of attractiveness, independence, and sophistication”.About 40 percent of the respondents identified themselves as very light smokers, with a habit of smoking one or two cigarettes either daily or occasionally. About 12 percent said they were light smokers, smoking two to three cigarettes a day.Of the remaining 46 percent, about a fourth said they had quit smoking, the report added.The survey was conducted by Assocham Social Development Foundation among 2,000 women in the age group of 22-30 years in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region), Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Pune.', 'Maruti and Honda are both working hard to get hybrid cars into production in India by 2020 or 2022. The change is being driven by the impending 2022 CAFE norms. While today’s adjusted-for-kerb-weight Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (or Consumption in India) figure of 138g of CO2 per kilometre (for the fleet) isn’t too stringent, the upcoming limit of 113g per kilometer, to be introduced in 2022, will be extremely difficult to meet, especially for petrol cars. In simple terms, this is because CO2 output is directly proportional to fuel economy. So, while fuel-efficient diesels will have a tough time with emission norms but will meet CO2 norms more easily, less efficient petrol cars will be in a bind. And then there’s the fact that petrols are generally lighter: remember the weight-adjusted bit. This is why come 2022, carmakers who already are familiar with hybrid tech will try and shift to petrol-electric as soon as possible. Electrification of a petrol engine, after all, helps make it more efficient because electric systems operate at a much higher level of efficiency as against internal combustion engines (90 percent vs 35 percent), improving the combined efficiency.Of the two companies – Honda and Maruti – going hammer and tongs at hybrid tech in India, it’s the latter that is likely to be the first off the blocks. The company’s head of engineering, C V Raman is pretty clear: “What we are looking at doing is improving our internal combustion engines by hybridising them”. Options include ISG (Integrated Starter Generators) or SHVS-like systems as well as stronger hybrids. And it’s the latter Maruti is looking at more seriously. Get this: while a similarly specified Swift petrol delivers 22.6kpl in Japan’s JC08 test cycle, the Swift hybrid that gets a strong 10kW electric boost from its 100V system delivers 32kpl.The configuration for India will be different. We are unlikely to get Suzuki’s Dualjet engine here and the boost is likely to be in the region of 8kW as against 10. But the ramp-up in efficiency could actually be the same; which, in effect, works out to a real-world figure of around 19kpl under Autocar India’s city cycle. Wow. Even the difference in price in Japan isn’t too much. A Swift hybrid, assuming all components are localised (which they may not be initially), will not cost more than a diesel version of the same model. And what is likely to help is that Maruti will source the battery pack from the Suzuki-Denso-Toshiba consortium that will start producing lithium-ion batteries here by 2020.Honda is the other company looking at locally assembling hybrids here. Yoichiro Ueno, Honda’s boss in India, says he’s already seeing the potential of hybrid cars here, especially after the 2022 CAFE regulations hit. “It would be essential to launch hybrid vehicles to meet norms.” Honda has already seen that importing hybrids doesn’t work: “Some components may have to be imported in the beginning, but we want to maximise the locally made parts.” And Honda could also export hybrid engines from India, just like it does its 1.5 and 1.6 Earth Dreams diesels. Honda, however, is unlikely to go in for a conventional hybrid setup, similar to its earlier IMA (Integrated Motor Assist)- equipped cars. The carmaker already has a City Hybrid that is sold in Malaysia. But the big news is that it is unlikely to go with this 110hp engine that gets a 22kW electric boost. What Honda is looking to do is skip an entire generation and go straight to its new and frankly amazing range extender-like hybrid system seen on the Accord. Known as Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD), the car works either as an electric car in Hybrid Drive Operation (HDO), with the petrol engine charging the battery and the e-motors powering the wheels, or in Engine Drive Operation (EDO), where drive from the engine is sent to the wheels directly, but via a single gear equivalent to fourth, for reduced transmission losses. For the record, the Accord Hybrid delivers a real-world figure of 17.4kpl under Autocar’s city test cycle. Imagine what it could deliver in a car that weighs half a tonne less and has a smaller 1.5-litre engine?It’s not clear what hybrid configurations Maruti and Honda will come with first. Launch dates are nowhere near final and it’s not clear which models will come first. However, one thing is for sure – come 2022, fuel-efficiency figures are set to zoom.', 'Kolkata: Hasin Jahan, wife of Indian cricketer Mohammed Shami, who has alleged that the Team India pacer has multiple extra-marital affairs and his family tried to kill her, has now made even more sensational claim, on a day when a FIR was registered against Shami.Jahan filed a written complaint against the cricketer and the FIR was lodged against Shami and his four family members in Kolkata’s Jadavpur police station under several Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections, including section 498A, which amounts to cruelty to a woman by her husband or his relatives.The other charges recorded against Shami are under Section 307 – attempt to murder, Section 323 – punishment for voluntarily causing hurt, Section 376 – rape, Section 506 – criminal intimidation, Section 328 and Section 34.Amidst all the legal proceedings, Jahan, as reported by DNA, has also made a claim that Shami forced her to have physical relations with his brother. Jahan also alleged that Shami, when on tour, had physical relations with sex workers.Jahan was a divorcee and had two daughters from her previous marriage when she met Shami for the first time. She said that she was keen to make the marriage work with Shami after her first marriage broke down.“I am not in touch with my first husband. Out of my two girls, one is staying with me while the other one is studying,” Jahan told DNA.Jahan, who had earlier claimed that Shami wanted to marry a Bollywood actress, also alleged that the Indian pacer is a double-faced man before adding that he also has a Pakistani girlfriend, whom he wanted to accompany him during India’s tour to Sri Lanka in 2017.“Shami is a double-faced man. Before marriage, he never told me about his affair with this Pakistani girl,” she said.Jahan, who had been a model and a cheerleader for Kolkata Knight Riders in Indian Premier League (IPL) in the past, also alleged that Shami started to torture immediately after their marriage in 2014.“Shami started torturing me mentally and physically in every possible manner. Whereas, I gave up everything – modelling career and job – after getting married to him,” Jahan said.She labelled Shami a womaniser and never involved in her any of the financial matters before adding that she will “teach him a lesson”.“One thing is certain that I will teach Shami a lesson for all his misdeeds.”“I got married to Shami on April 7, 2014 and from the very beginning I got to know about his misdeeds. He is a big-time womaniser and has never been a faithful husband to me. He has never involved me in any of his financial matters,” she concluded.', 'Kochi: The Air Intelligence Unit officers of the Customs at the Cochin International Airport has foiled a bid to smuggle in gold in powdered form and seized 925 grams of the yellow metal valued at Rs 29 lakh.Two passengers who flew in from Dubai on Thursday were arrested. “The gold seized was in powdered form converted into a semi-solid compound paste. The duo had concealed the said paste in the waste belt worn by them,” Customs Commissioner Sumit Kumar said.With the Customs intensifying checks at the airport and deploying more personnel, the smugglers have been adopting clever ways to smuggle gold like body concealment, deep concealment in motors etc.“But with these tactics failing, now they have resorted to neo-age alchemy.

This was the fourth highest run chase in T20 Internationals and Bangladesh’s best.Blazing half-centuries by Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera had powered Sri Lanka to a formidable 214 for six after Bangladesh opted to bowl. When his time to bat came, Mushfiqur slammed four sixes and five boundaries during a smashing knock.Needing nine off the last over, Mushfiqur slashed Thisara Perera for a boundary to inch closer to victory. Before that, the experienced wicketkeeper hit a six after 19 were required in the last two overs. If the Lankans were off to a flyer, Bangladesh’ start was blistering as they raced to 74 in just six under overs, before Liton Das’ whirlwind 19-ball 43-run knock came to an end.The Tigers continued to roar as Tamim Iqbal (47) and Soumya Sarkar (24) kept up with the required run rate to reach 100 in the 10th over. However, having blazed away to 47 off 29 balls with the help of six boundaries and a six, Tamim offered a return catch to Thisara Perera in the over they got to the three-figure mark. That was Thisara’s 50th wicket in T20 Internationals.Liton Das had smashed five sixes and two fours. The experienced Mushfiqur Rahim and skipper Mahmudullah then joined hands in the middle. Mushfiqur seemed determined to take his side as close to the target as possible, hitting Shanaka for a six and four off successive balls in the 12th over.They needed 112 at the back 10 at little over 12 runs an over. After a six in the 17th over, Mushfiqur started the next over with four to put pressure on Sri Lanka and he sustained it till the end to see Bangladesh home.Earlier, Mendis (57) and Perera (74) toyed with the Bangladesh attack with a flurry of boundaries and sixes, to the delight of the home crowd at the Premadasa Stadium. Invited to bat after a drizzle delayed the toss by 15 minutes, Sri Lanka were off to a flying start with Mendis putting on 56 runs for the opening wicket with Danushka Gunathilaka (26).Bangladesh pacers were guilty of bowling short and the Lankans took full advantage of that, pummelling them for 70 runs in the six mandatory powerplay overs. That the visitors persisted with bowling short despite getting smacked, too helped Sri Lanka’s cause.Mendis hit 57 off 30 balls with the help of five sixes and two fours, Perera found the fence eight times and cleared it twice in his 48-ball knock. That set the tone for a big total and even though Mustafizur Rahman cleaned up Gunathilaka, the hosts were sitting pretty at the halfway stage at 98 for one.There was a lull though, from seventh to ninth over, as the hosts managed just 16 runs in 18 balls. The well-settled Mendis hoicked Nazmul Islam over square leg for a six to break the shackles. It was then the turn of the other Kusal – Perera – as he smashed Mehidy Hasan for a six and four, helping Sri Lanka race to 111 for one at the end of 11th over.Continuing his stellar run at the top, Mendis meanwhile welcomed Mustafizur with a six and brought up his fifty in just 26 balls, his third half-century in four innings. Bangladesh had a breakthrough but not before Mendis sent a Mahmudullah delivery soaring over deep mid-wicket for another maximum.Dasun Shanaka and Dinesh Chandimal fell cheaply but Upul Tharanga helped Sri Lanka score 17 runs in the 17th over with the help of two boundaries and a six. Tharanga was unbeaten on a breezy 32 off 15 balls. Meanwhile, Perera continued his onslaught on the Bangladesh bowlers and was mostly dealing in boundaries. He got out while going for one too many, getting stumped off Mustafizur.\\nMustafizur Rahman (3/48) and Mahmudullah (2/15) were the most successful bowlers for Bangladesh.Brief scores: Sri Lanka: 214/6 in 20 overs (Kusal Perera 74, Kusal Mendis 57; Mustafizur Rahman 3/48); Bangladesh: 215/5 in 19.4 overs (Tamim Iqbal 47, Liton Das 41, Mushfiqur Rahim 72 not out).', 'Ipoh (Malaysia): India finished fifth at the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament with a 4-1 thrashing of Ireland on Saturday. Varun Kumar scored twice from penalty corners while Shilanand Lakra and Gurjant Singh got the other goals for India.Julian Dale exploited some poor marking by the Indian defenders to get a consolation goal for the European minnows in the final quarter. India thus avenged the 2-3 loss to Ireland in their last league stage match on Friday which had eliminated their already slim chances of qualifying for the medal rounds.Ireland finished sixth in the tournament.

The pact — to “facilitate the reciprocal provision of logistics support, supplies and services between the armed forces of the two countries during authorised port visits, joint exercises, joint training, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts” — was described by Mr Modi as a “golden step in the history of our close defence cooperation”.  He also described France as one of India’s most trusted defence partners, adding that “from land to sky there is no such topic where we are not working together with each other”.Reflecting a growing depth in defence ties, India and France inked the strategic pact providing for the use of each other’s military facilities including opening naval bases to warships, an agreement that comes amid China’s growing military expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.With India already acquiring 36 French Rafale state-of-the-art fighter aircraft and the two countries expressing satisfaction over the progress in the matter, news agencies cited officials as saying that the French side pushed for the procurement of another batch of 36 Rafale fighters by India during a meeting between defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and her French counterpart Florence Parly.', 'Hyderabad: The Telugu Desam (TD) and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) did not get any invitation till Saturday for the much-hyped dinner to be hosted by former Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi has decided to host dinner to all Opposition parties on March 13 in Delhi. In fact, TD and TRS leaders were not expecting an invitation from the Congress to the dinner. The TD in Andhra Pradesh and TRS in Telangana are arch rivals of the Congress. Both have decided not to attend the dinner even if they receive an invitation. TRS chief and Telangana state Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is busy with the formation of the Third Front as alternative to the BJP and the Congress at the National-level. “I don’t think the Congress will extend an invitation to the TRS.

', 'Indian cricketer Mohammad Shami has called for a thorough investigation into allegations of extra-marital affair and domestic violence by his wife Hasin Jahan. Speaking to news agency ANI, the Indian pacer said that the he does not want to give an explanation on the accusations that are increasing each day.“There have been many accusations which are increasing day by day. I don’t want to give an explanation about it and I want it to be investigated thoroughly,” said Shami.He further said that he had “full faith” on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that “whatever decision they take will be after much deliberation and investigation. “I have no tension regarding that,” he added.This comes as the cricketer was charged with attempted murder after his wife filed a complaint against him. There were seven charges against the pacer. A non-bailable warrant was issued against Shami following the filing of the case.Hasin Jahan also accused Shami’s elder brother Hasib Ahmad of raping her when she went to her in-law’s place in 2017. She alleged, “My husband’s elder brother, Hasib Ahmad, raped me when I went to my in-laws’ place in Uttar Pradesh last year.”Talking about the case, Jahan’s lawyer Zakir Hossain had said, “I have been informed by Kolkata police officers over phone that they have slapped non-bailable sections against Shami and starting a case against him.”Following Jahan’s allegations, the BCCI had also left the 27-year-old bowler out of their contract scheme. “The BCCI has taken cognisance of all the reports emerging about Mohammed Shami’s personal life. It is purely a personal matter and the BCCI has nothing to do with it. However, keeping in mind that the woman in question has met the police commissioner of Kolkata, it is only prudent on BCCI’s part to wait for any official inquiry to take place,” a board official was quoted as saying by PTI.Shami, on his part, has denied all allegations against him, saying it was an attempt to derail his cricket career.

the rising Asian superpower indefinitely, with potential abstentions offering the only suspense in the historic vote.The National People’s Congress is all but certain to approve a constitutional amendment that has stunned many in China, sparking an unusual bout of criticism that censors have scrambled to extinguish.The move reverses the era of “collective” leadership and orderly succession that was promoted by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to ensure stability following the turbulent one-man rule of Communist China’s founder Mao Zedong.Xi, 64, has consolidated power since taking office as general secretary of the Communist Party in 2012 — his most important title, which has no term limits but which his two predecessors both gave up after two terms.He would have had to give up the presidency after the end of his second term in 2023, but he could now have a lifetime to push his vision of a rejuvenated China as a global powerhouse with a “world-class” military.His rise has been accompanied by tighter restrictions on civil society, with the detention of activists and human rights lawyers, and stricter limits on the already heavily-controlled internet.At the same time, he gained a measure of popularity among Chinese people through a relentless crackdown on corruption that has punished more than a million party officials, and sidelined potential rivals.“I think that during the past five years, he has been carrying out a soft coup, including making the Politburo a mere figurehead,” Chinese political commentator Wu Qiang told AFP, referring to the 25-member Communist Party body one level under the ruling council.“He wants to prevent power from falling into the hands of technocrats like Jiang (Zemin) and Hu (Jintao),” Wu said, referring to Xi’s two predecessors.While attention has focused on the term limits, the amendments also include major provisions that will engrave Xi’s eponymous political mantra in the constitution and hand the Communist Party an even larger role in the country’s affairs.The legislation is expected to easily secure the two-thirds of votes needed to pass in the legislature, which has never voted down a Communist Party diktat in its half-century of existence.But if any of the nearly 3,000 legislators are secretly unhappy about the move, they could cast a protest vote by abstaining.While the voting is secret, analysts say there are probably ways to know how delegates vote.“Some deputies who insist on Deng Xiaoping’s reform line will think that this constitutional amendment is a retrogression and abandons Deng’s legacy,” Beijing-based political commentator Hua Po said.“They may vote against or abstain from voting to safeguard Deng’s political legacy,” Hua said.The Communist Party, which says the move merely aligns the presidency with the limit-free titles of party and military chief, claims “the masses” unanimously called for the removal of term limits.But the proposal was kept secret until it was revealed in a state media report on February 25, a week before the legislature’s opening session.The party later disclosed that Xi had presided over a meeting of the Politburo in September during which the leadership decided to revise the constitution.The party then sought proposals and opinions, culminating in a decision in late January to introduce constitutional amendments at the NPC.The surprise move triggered a backlash online, prompting censors to block phrases and words such as “I disagree” and “emperor” and the image of Winnie the Pooh, the cartoon bear to which Xi has been compared.', 'Washington: Kim Jong Un’s decision to invite Donald Trump to a historic summit is evidence that the American leader’s efforts to isolate his North Korean counterpart are bearing fruit, US Vice President Mike Pence said today.“North Korea’s desire to meet to discuss denuclearisation – while suspending all ballistic missile and nuclear testing – is evidence that President Trump’s strategy to isolate the Kim regime is working,” Pence said in a statement.The North Koreans “are coming to the table despite the United States making zero concessions and, in close coordination with our allies, we have consistently increased the pressure on the Kim regime,” he said.“Our resolve is undeterred and our policy remains the same, all sanctions remain in place and the maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes concrete, permanent, and verifiable steps to end their nuclear program.”Trump’s agreement yesterday to meet North Korea’s reclusive leader marked a stunning development in America’s high-stakes nuclear standoff with North Korea – interpreted by some analysts as a diplomatic win for Kim.Previous North Korean leaders have sought face-to-face talks with consecutive US presidents, who consistently rebuffed the idea.Faced with Pyongyang’s race to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the continental United States, Trump’s strategy has been to ramp up sanctions, tighten the diplomatic screws and regularly threaten military force.But as last month’s Winter Olympics drove a rapprochement on the peninsula, Pence travelled to South Korea, rubbing shoulders with Kim’s sister, and appearing open to a meeting with North Korean officials – although it was the North Koreans and South Koreans who actually met.US officials said Pyongyang had scrapped secretly planned talks at the last minute after Pence denounced abuses from North Korea’s “murderous regime.”', 'AGARTALA: Following a massive political sweep in Tripura, newly-elected Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Saturday assumed office in Agartala. Deb chaired a cabinet meeting shortly after he assumed the office.On Friday, 48-year-old Deb took oath as the state’s 10th Chief Minister in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, BJP veterans Murali Manohar Joshi and LK Advani and outgoing CM Manik Sarkar.The rise of Biplab has been nothing short of remarkable and the ascent of his party has been nothing short of historic. The BJP had demolished the communist citadel of Tripura, winning a two-thirds majority with ally IPFT and ending 25 years of uninterrupted rule of the CPI(M)-led Left Front. The saffron party had secured less than two percent votes in the 2013 polls.Taking the party to the far-flung tribal regions in the state has been widely regarded as the key reason for the success and it was spearheaded by a former RSS worker called Biplab Deb. The former gym trainer galvanised BJP forces in the state and was rewarded for his perseverance.BJP, which had no MLAs in the outgoing Assembly and polled just 1.5 percent votes in the 2013 elections, losing deposits in 49 of the 50 constituencies it contested, secured over 42 percent of votes in the February 18, 2018, Tripura elections.', 'Beijing: Chinese Muslims need to guard against creeping Islamisation, including mosques that copy foreign styles, and strive to practice their faith in a more Chinese way, a senior Chinese Islamic official said on Saturday.China is home to roughly 20 million Muslims, many living in the western part of the country, from the Uighurs of Xinjiang who speak a Turkic language to the largely sinified Hui people. While China officially guarantees freedom of religion, it has in recent years tightened controls in heavily Muslim areas, nervous about the possibility of radicalisation and violence.Speaking to the largely ceremonial advisory body to China’s parliament, Yang Faming, head of the government-linked China Islamic Association, said Islam had a long and glorious history in the country.But Yang warned of problems he said had become apparent in recent years which could not be overlooked, according to a copy of his speech carried by the official Xinhua news agency.“For example, some mosques’ construction style blindly imitates foreign models. In some areas the concept of halal has become common, and religion interferes in secular life,” he said.“Some people set great store on religious rules and much less on national law, only knowing what it is to be a believer and not what it is to be a citizen,” Yang added. “We must certainly remain on high alert.”Islam in China must uphold the successful experience of becoming more Chinese, be guided by core socialist values and oppose radicalisation, he said.Religious practices, culture and the architecture of religious buildings must be Chinese in nature and style, Yang added.Parliament and its advisory body are holding their annual session.China has blamed a series of attacks in recent years in Xinjiang, which sits on the borders of Central Asia and Pakistan on Islamist terrorists. Rights groups say the unrest is more a reaction to Chinese controls on the religious and cultural rights of the Uighurs who live there.China denies accusations of repression in Xinjiang.China’s image among the wider Muslim community around the world is important to Beijing as it pushes President Xi Jinping’s “Belt and Road” initiative to invest billions of dollars building infrastructure linking Asia, Europe and Africa.', 'Colombo: Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena Saturday left on a foreign tour even as his country has been hit by communal violence that has killed at least two people.

He will also visit Japan. The President had proclaimed a state of emergency to quell the riots and Kandy was under curfew for five days. The government also blocked social media in another desperate attempt to curb rumours and violence.Sinhala mobs went on a rampage after a Sinhalese man died in a traffic accident. The incident was reportedly used to fan communal passions.Mr Sirisena’s government has come under fire for its inability to take timely action to curb the tensions.Sinhalese Buddhists make up about 75 per cent of Sri Lanka’s 21 million population while Muslims are 10 per cent.Tensions between Muslim groups and the majority Sinhalese Buddhist community in the country have escalated since the end of the civil war in May 2009.', 'THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Commissioner of Customs (Kochi) Sumit Kumar on Saturday appealed more citizens to turn bounty hunters by providing information about smuggling. In a press conference at Thiruvananthapuram, he said that the seizures of gold, narcotics and currencies have increased in customs bases at Kerala.   “Our informers can be rewarded up to 30 percent of the market value of the seized products. They needn’t come to court or take part in legal procedures. We will not contact them again. We seek more public support as more cases were being busted,” Mr Kumar said. He said that those caught with contraband recently and henceforth will have their passports annulled.“Several people are being caught with contraband under the belt, gold in rectum etc from all three airports. Other than under the provisions under Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA), Prevention of Money Laundering Act and Indian Penal Code we will now be book them under Passports Act,” he said. A new container scanner was being acquired at Kochi to scan shipments and detect exporters who engaged in nefarious activities. Similarly, dog squads and scanning devices at all three airports were being boosted. “Though we manage work with a small workforce, budget proposals seek to increase the territorial jurisdiction of the central agency from 24 nautical miles to 320 km around Indian shores. This will be a game changer,” said. During the ongoing fiscal until February, gold worth around Rs 1.96 crore, currency worth Rs 90. 86 lakh were seized. Consumer cases worth around Rs 2.91 crore were registered and drugs were also seized.

According to the police, Ganesh was working as a lorry driver while the girl was studying Class XI. They were in a relationship from the past few months. Recently, both the victims’ parents came to know about their affair and warned them to stay away from each other due to which they were depressed. In addition, their community differences added to their woes. On Friday afternoon, the duo suddenly went missing from their homes.  Worried, Pujitha’s parents lodged a kidnap case at the Narketpalli police station against Ganesh. While police started an investigation, locals of Ramannapet noticed the bodies near the railway tracks behind the Government Degree College and alerted the police. A case under suspicious death was registered and the bodies were handed over to the families.

Their first attempt to break open a ventilator was recorded in the CCTV camera, Kulsumpura police said.  “The boys seem to be ragpickers aged between 10-12 years, said inspector of Kulsumpura, Ram Mohan Rao, adding that the light-weighted plywood doors helped them to easily get inside the shop. “The boys broke the door open with a blunt object and as they were short and skinny, they slipped in and walked out with Rs 3,000 in big denominations and Rs 3,000 in smaller denominations, a total of Rs 6,000,” said the official, adding that no liquor bottles were reported missing.

Passport details must for loans above Rs 50 crore. Step to ensure quick response in case of fraud,” Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar tweeted.This is a preventive step to avoid flight of economic offenders and banks to collect passport details of all new borrowers of loans in excess of Rs 50 crore, he said. For all existing loans of over Rs 50 crore, banks have been asked to collect passport details of borrowers within 45 days, he added.In absence of passport details, banks were hamstrung in taking timely action to prevent defaulters especially wilful one from fleeing the country. Several big defaulters like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Vijay Mallya and Jatin Mehta have fled the country putting the recovery mechanism in quandary.Last week, the Cabinet approved the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill after Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi allegedly defrauded state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) of Rs 12,700 crore and left the country and are refusing to cooperate with law enforcement agencies.The proposed fugitive law aims to impound and sell assets of Nirav Modi-type escapees with a view to quickly recover dues. It also will apply to defaulters who have an outstanding of Rs 100 crore or more and have escaped from the country.As part of drive to clean the banking system, the Finance Ministry last week had directed public sector banks (PSBs) to probe all NPA accounts of over Rs 50 crore for possible fraud and accordingly report the cases to CBI.Besides, the ministry had asked banks to monitor loans above Rs 250 crore and red flags whenever the original covenants of the loans are violated. This was spelt out as part of 6-point-reform measures announced for PSBs in January.', 'India will get its first luxury convertible SUV with Jaguar Land Rover set to launch the Range Rover Evoque Convertible in the country on March 27, 2018. The model made its international debut at the 2015 Los Angeles motor show. As per details on Jaguar Land Rover’s India website, the model will come powered by JLR’s latest 2.0-litre Ingenium petrol that made its India debut on the Velar. The four-cylinder unit puts out 240hp of peak power (250hp in the Velar) and 340Nm of torque and comes mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission that channels power to all-four wheels. The SUV can sprint to 100kph from standstill in 8.1 seconds and go on to a top speed of 217kph.The Evoque Convertible for India will be available in the fully-loaded HSE Dynamic form and will get features such as adaptive LED headlights, leather seats, navigation and ambient lighting.The drop-top Evoque gets a reinforced monocoque chassis along with reinforced door panels to make up for the lack of a roof. The fabric convertible roof is electrical and can be operated in around 20 seconds while the vehicle is travelling at speeds of up to 48kph. Land Rover says the roof uses an acoustic inner lining in an effort to reduce road noise and enhance cabin insulation. A wind deflector, offered as an option, reduces air draft from the rear when the roof is down, thereby improving front seat comfort. The SUV additionally comes equipped with a pop-up roll-bar system that deploys if there is a danger of a rollover.While there is no word on pricing as yet, we expect the Evoque Convertible to cost in the region of Rs 80-85 lakh (estimated, ex-showroom).', 'Zenvo has unveiled a new track-focused and road-legal hypercar – the TSR-S. The car uses a ramped up version of its flat-plane crank V8, and puts out 1,193hp.On show at the Geneva motor show, the mid-engine two-door has about 14hp over the TS1 GT, which it is based on. It has an all-carbon-fibre body built over a steel and aluminium monocoque.Zenvo’s 5.8-litre engine uses a trio of superchargers to offer muscular performance, enabling a 0-100kph time of 2.8sec and 0-200kph time of 6.8sec in the TSR-S in the TSR-S – identical to the McLaren Senna. Its top speed is limited to 325kph.The car’s powertrain can be set through three modes that adjust power from 710hp to its peak output. Drive for the 1,495kg TSR-S is sent through a seven-speed, paddle-shift gearbox with straight-cut gears.The car features a new exterior design with race-inspired aerodynamics, with the key component for downforce an active rear wing. To keep weight down, the cabin features only the bare essentials, so there’s no air-conditioning, radio or airbags. Instead, there are carbon seats and six-point harnesses.Pricing is unconfirmed but based on its pricing for the TS1 GT, it’s likely to be upward of Rs 10.8 crore – which seems justified, considering Zenvo produces just five cars, every year, from its facility in Præstø, Denmark.', 'Robert Pattinson, who broke up with FKA Twigs in October last year, was reportedly inseparable from pop star Mabel at two events.

The Foreign Minister is seen waving his hand to the gathering when suddenly someone from behind threw black ink targetting his face.#WATCH: A man throws ink on Pakistan Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif while he was attending an event in Sialkot, Pakistan last night. pic.twitter.com/1Rcm6JTP2UThe suspect, who was thrashed by the party workers before being handed over to police, allegedly said that Asif’s party had tried to change the finality of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) in the Constitution which hurt his sentiments.Asif was speaking at the PML-N workers’ convention in Sialkot, his hometown (some 100km from Lahore), when a middle-aged man with long beard, who was standing close to him, threw ink on his face.The workers grabbed the man and thrashed him before handing him over to police. The foreign minister was escorted by his guard after the incident. However, after washing his face, Asif returned and completed his speech.“I do not know this man. It appears my opponents had given him some money to throw ink at me but I pardon this man and will ask the police to release him,” the minister said, adding this incident does not affect his politics.“Such an incident adds sympathy for him,” he said.Meanwhile, the Sialkot city police identified the man who threw ink as Faiz Rasool.“Rasool doesn’t have any connection with any political party. He told police in his statement that he threw ink at the foreign minister because his party had tried to change the finality of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) in the Constitution. This hurt the sentiments of millions of Pakistanis including his,” a police officer quoted Rasool as having said in his statement.He said since the minister is not interested in getting an FIR registered against Rasool, police will set him free after meeting all legal requirements.Pakistan’s Law Minister Zahid Hamid had to resign last November when hundreds of Tehreek-e-Labbaik supporters camped at Islamabad’s Faizabad traffic interchange, forcing the PML-N government to take action against those in the federal cabinet responsible for attempting to change this clause from the Constitution.In another incident, a shoe was hurled at former Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif by a student during an event in Lahore. Nawaz Sharif was meeting those present at the stage when a shoe came towards him.

We understand that they may have caused concern and upset to people, especially the more vulnerable members of society,” said Assistant Chief Constable Angela Williams of West Yorkshire Police said.“Public safety remains our priority and I would urge our communities to be vigilant but not frightened,” she added.Counter-terrorism police are treating the letters as a possible hate crime.Images of the A4 note, which contains a list of violent acts alongside a number of claims of why they were executed, have been widely shared online.The note incites verbal abuse and assaults on Muslims, as well as attacks on mosques. It asks people to carry out violent acts including verbal abuse, removing a woman’s hijab or head-scarf, physical assault and using acid as a weapon. These were ranked using a points-based system, with the letter stating, “There will be rewards based on action taken”.Police said it had a couple of letters that will undergo analysis in an attempt to determine their origin.Tell MAMA [Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks], a project that monitors Islamaphobic hate crimes in the UK, said a photo of an envelope suggested at least one of the notes was dealt with at a Sheffield sorting office.“This has caused quite a lot of fear within the community. They are asking if they are safe, if their children are safe to play outdoors. We have told them to keep calm,” said Iman Atta from Tell MAMA.The group said it had received reports of people in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield receiving the letters.A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said it was not yet clear whether any criminal allegations relating to the letters had been reported in London.', 'New Delhi: Declaring that India wanted a solar revolution not just in the country but across the world and announcing the establishment of a “Solar Technology Mission”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced the allocation of a whopping $1.4 billion as part of its Line of Credit for 27 solar projects in 15 developing countries. Mr Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron co-chaired the founding conference of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in the national capital that is being attended by over 20 heads and deputy heads of government, a majority of them African.  Mr Modi said, “We want a solar revolution not just in India but the world… India will begin the solar technology mission to bridge the gap in solar technology.”Interestingly, 23 out of these 27 projects for which Mr Modi offered financial assistance are in African countries where observers point out that India has been trying its best to counter Chinese influence. The remaining four projects are in India’s neighbourhood of which two each are in Bangladesh (worth a total of $180 million) and Sri Lanka ($100 million). This is apart from 13 solar development projects — either completed or under implementation — under Indian Line of Credit worth $143 million in African countries.The proposed solar projects abroad are also expected to boost the Indian economy since 75 per cent of these have to be sourced from India as per the guidelines. The $1.4 billion will be part of the $2 billion under the Indian Line of Credit that will be allocated and in turn part of the $10 billion for development projects abroad that have been “pledged” by New Delhi earlier.The solar projects pertain to energy for infrastructure such as health centres, high schools, hand-pump boreholes, power plants, street-lighting projects and drinking water-supply located in countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Congo, Ghana, Mali, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, Seychelles and Rwanda A total of 32 countries have both signed and ratified the agreement while another 30 have just signed but not ratified it as yet.', 'Hyderabad: The Rs 5-lakh free insurance scheme for farmers announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao recently will be implemented from June 2 on the occasion of Telangana State Formation Day.Agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy on Sunday held a  meeting with LIC officials to finalise the modalities for the scheme. The CM announced that there was no need for farmers to pay any premium to avail this scheme and the government itself will bear the premium on their behalf.As per revenue records purified by the state government recently, there are nearly 72 lakh farmers in the state.The families of deceased farmers will get Rs 5 lakh compensation in case of the death of a farmer covered under the scheme for any reason. Though the premium amount for each farmer is yet to be finali-sed, the government exp-ects it to be nearly Rs 1,000.With this, the government needs to spend around Rs 720 crore every year towards payment of premium on behalf of farmers. The funds required for the purpose will be allotted in the Budget 2018-19.', 'New Delhi: Rattled by spate of banking frauds, RBI has initiated special audit of state-owned lenders with focus on trade financing activities, especially relating to issuance of letters of undertakings (LoUs) by them, sources said.In addition, the RBI has asked all banks for details of the LoUs they had written, including the amounts outstanding, and whether the banks had pre-approved credit limits or kept enough cash on margin before issuing the guarantees. Most of the big banking frauds which were unearthed in the recent past, including the one perpetuated by diamantaire Nirav Modi and his associates, pertain to trade finance. Also, many of the willful default cases have their roots in trade finance, the sources said.  In view of the recent Rs 12,646-crore PNB scam, done through fraudulent issuance of LoUs by connivance of the bank’s staff, it was pertinent for the regulator RBI to examine the issue of trade finance which also included issuance of letter of credit and LoUs, sources said.Soon after Nirav Modi case came to light, the CBI registered a case against a Delhi-based diamond jewellery exporter Dwarka Das Seth International for an alleged bank loan fraud to the tune of Rs 389.85 crore towards Oriental Bank of Commerce. Dwarka Das Seth International availed various credit facilities from OBC between 2007-12.Also, in the Bank of Baroda fraud case of 2015, two Delhi-based businessmen cheated it of Rs 6,000 crore by using the trade finance mechanism.', 'NEW DELHI: A day after Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi was re-elected as the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh Sarkaryawah (General Secretary) for a period of three years, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha on Sunday appointed Manmohan Vaidya and Mukunda as Joint General Secretaries of the right-wing Hindu outfit.The appointment of Vaidya and Mukunda is in addition to the current Joint General Secretaries Suresh Soni, Krishna Gopal, Dattatreya Hosabale and V Bhagaiah.Manmohan Vaidya and Mukunda appointed as Joint General Secretaries of RSS in addition to the current Joint General Secretaries Suresh Soni, Krishna Gopal, Dattatreya Hosabale and V Bhagaiah. pic.twitter.com/NOqSDEX4zQ— ANI (@ANI) March 11, 2018A decision to this effect was taken during the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha in Nagpur.Manmohan Vaidya was the communications in-charge of the RSSEarlier on Saturday, Joshi was re-elected by Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the executive head of the organisation which looks after its day-to-day activities.Joshi was on Saturday re-elected by Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the executive head of the organisation which looks after its day-to-day activities.Maananeeya Sri Suresh ( Bhaiyaji) Joshi re-elected as #RSS Sarkaryavah ( General Secretary ) for a period of 3 years (2018-2021) by the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha at Nagpur. #RSSABPS pic.twitter.com/e8ul1iqhyr— RSS (@RSSorg) March 10, 2018On Friday a crucial triennial meeting of the RSS took place to chalk out its agenda and course of action for the next three years.The post of Sarkaryawah is effectively the number two after Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat.Joshi was unanimously re-elected as the RSS general secretary for a third time in March 2015.

The messaging app has a feature where a sender can find out if their message has been received and then read, practically the same second that it happens.The message report begins with one grey tick (when sent), then two grey ticks (when the message has reached their phone), then two blue ticks (when it’s been read).Although many of us might not be having any issue switching this optional feature on in WhatsApp but then there are times when you don’t want others or the sender to know that you have already read his/her message.For this, one of the options can be to enter the settings inside WhatsApp and turn off the particular feature. Unfortunately, this turns off the feature for all and doesn’t let you know if the other person has read your texts or not.So what can be an easier alternative using which you don’t switch off the feature for yourself and others but can still prevent those double ticks to not turn blue even after you’ve read the message? Check details below.This one’s a no-brainer actually and doesn’t require any tweaking with the settings at all.Step 1: When a text message arrives on WhatsApp, the first thing to do is to scroll down the notification panel and switch on the aeroplane mode.Step 2: Once offline, open the WhatsApp chat and read the message.Step 3: Once read, close the app from the multi-window so it doesn’t stay open in the background and sync when you go online.Step 4: After closing the app completely, switch off the aeroplane mode again.It is worth adding that when you are in the aeroplane mode and are reading the WhatsApp message, make sure you close the app completely by swiping it away from the multi-window section. If you keep simply press the back button, the app won’t close and will keep running in the background. As a result, as soon as you go online by switching off the aeroplane mode, the double ticks will turn blue as the app, which is actively running in the background, will sync.', 'New York: Eating more of dietary fibres that promote a type of gut bacteria may help in the fight against Type 2 diabetes, researchers suggest.Research findings showed that a diversified high fibre diet can promote 15 strains of gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which provide energy to gut cells, reduce inflammation and help regulate hunger. “Our study lays the foundation and opens the possibility that fibres targeting this group of gut bacteria could eventually become a major part of your diet and your treatment,” said lead author Liping Zhao, Professor at the Rutgers University-New Brunswick.Consuming right dietary fibres may rebalance the gut microbiota, or the ecosystem of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract that help digest food and are important for overall human health.Promotion of a select group of gut bacteria by a diet high in diverse fibres led to better blood glucose control, greater weight loss and better lipid levels in people with Type 2 diabetes, the researchers said.For the study, published in the journal Science, the team selected group of SCFA-producing microbes responsible for the positive impact of high-fibre diets on patients with Type 2 diabetes, randomised into two groups. After 12 weeks, patients on the high-fibre diet had greater reduction in a three-month average of blood glucose levels. Their fasting blood glucose levels also dropped faster and they lost more weight.Zhao then sequenced microbial genes in the patients’ fecal samples, finding that the abundance of certain microbial species over others — as opposed to overall microbial diversity — seemed more closely correlated with health-related changes in the gut microbiota. The scientists identified 15 SCFA-producing strains that were specifically promoted by dietary fibres. These bacteria acted as a guild to augment SCFA production, consequently supporting gut health by out-competing microbes that release compounds hindering effective metabolism.', 'Kuala Lumpur/New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday that demonetisation was “not a good” initiative and if he were the prime minister he would have thrown the proposal into the “dustbin”.Gandhi is on a five-day trip to the Southeast Asian countries. He began the Malaysia leg of his visit on Saturday and interacted with an “enthusiastic gathering” of Indian diaspora in Kuala Lumpur. Asked how he would have rolled out demonetisation differently, Gandhi said “If I was the Prime Minister and somebody would have given me a file with demonetisation written on it, I would thrown it in the dustbin, out of the door and into the junkyard.”“That is how I would have rolled it out, because that is what I think should have been done with the demonetisation which was not good at all,” he said in a video shared by the Congress party on its Twitter handle.The demonetisation initiative was rolled out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016, announcing the invalidation of high-value currency notes currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.The Congress party has strongly criticised demonetisation, saying the move has led to economic slowdown.Earlier at the University of California, Berkeley, Gandhi had said that Modi had caused “tremendous damage” to India’s economy with his “reckless and dangerous” decisions like demonetisation and “hastily-applied” GST.Responding to a question on women empowerment, Gandhi also said equality was not “good enough” for women empowerment and asserted that women have to be given more support than men to end the bias against them.“I don’t treat women equal to men, but better than men. I think there is a bias in all societies, including in western society and that bias needs to be corrected. And to correct that bias, equality is not good enough, you have to be partial to women and give them more support than you give men,” he said.Gandhi also addressed a gathering of young professionals at IYCON in Kuala Lumpur.“Met Mr Subramaniam Sathasivam, president of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) in Kuala Lumpur. Originally a part of the AICC until 1946, the MIC has played a major role in the Malaysian Independence Movement,” he wrote on his facebook page.Gandhi’s trip is part of the Congress party’s efforts to connect with the diaspora.He called on Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday and discussed a wide range of topics related to India-Singapore ties.The trip is being organised by the AICC Overseas cell headed by technocrat Sam Pitroda, who helped former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi lead the IT revolution in India.Pitroda had earlier successfully organised Rahul Gandhi’s visits to the US and West Asia.Later in the year, the Congress president is also expected to travel to Dubai and Canada.', 'Geneva: Speaking at the 37th United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session, Dušan Vejinovic, a Senior Research Analyst at the European Foundation for South-Asian Studies brought into focus the numerous human rights violations by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.“Contrary to the country’s diplomatic rhetoric, it is Pakistan which has denied the people of Jammu and Kashmir their fundamental human rights,” he said. “Moreover, it is now aspiring to become a broker of Jammu and Kashmir, by negotiating the sale of Gilgit-Baltistan to Beijing, in return for stacks of Chinese Yuan,” he added.“While Pakistan manifests itself as a self-styled advocate of the rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, the factual situation is, that it remains an illegal occupier of Jammu and Kashmir, which has deprived the people of their political and civil liberties.”Urging the UN to take appropriate actions against Pakistan, he said “Why is Pakistan allowed to infringe international law and make a mockery of this august institution? The United Nations is obliged to act. Not only to ensure peace in South Asia, but more importantly, to maintain its own credibility and reinforce its authority.”The United Nations Resolutions had directed Pakistan to withdraw its troops from the state of Jammu and Kashmir on August 13, 1948. Vejinovic stated he was perplexed by Pakistan’s non-compliance to this legal binding for more than 70 years.Jammu and Kashmir has been an area of contention for both India and Pakistan ever since the nations were formed in 1947 with three battles having been fought between the two neighbours over it.', 'It looks like Varun Tej will have some royal company in the form of actress Aditi Rao Hydari on the sets of his upcoming film with Sankalp Reddy. The space thriller will see Varun donning an astronaut’s role with Aditi playing his colleague. The duo will be seen working together on a space mission in the film.“Aditi was quite impressed by the intriguing and fresh script that Sankalp narrated to her. The filmmakers were initially apprehensive if she’d be interested in the project, but were ecstatic seeing her enthusiasm after listening to the script; it was a boost for them,” shares a reliable source.Since it will be a space film, for which Varun has undergone some preliminary training in Kazakhstan, Aditi will be expected to do the same. However, the film will have one more female lead. “The other actress will have a comparatively small, but important role.

Has been doing a decent job ever since his comeback series against Sri Lanka in December. “Variations are most important for a bowler in this format. You talk about playing with the batsman’s mind and you can only do that with variations,” Unadkat said on eve of India’s match against Sri Lanka in the Nidahas Trophy.“You can see how hard batsmen are going at us in the Powerplay in this tournament. It is up to us how we come out of it and don’t allow them to hit. I back myself to do that,” said the left-arm pacer, who banks on his slower balls and cutters to deceive the batsmen.In the absence of senior bowlers, Unadkat opened the bowling alongside offie Washington Sundar in the first two games here. Unadkat praised Washington for doing a commendable job in the initial overs.“I think he is bowling really well. We have bowled together in the past for Pune in the IPL. What benefits us is that how he contains the batsman being an off-spinner, which is a very difficult job.“In this game the openers just come and try to blast their way through. He varies his pace really well and keeps it simple,” observed Unadkat.Indian bowlers fared better against Bangladesh after the hammering they received at the hands of Kusal Perera in the opener against Sri Lanka. Unadkat said the bowlers will only get better as the tournament progresses at Premdasa.“You can be under pressure 24 times (off a maximum 24 balls) in T20s. We executed our plans better against Bangladesh and it is only going better in the coming games,” he said.He was also impressed with Bangladesh’s record 215-run chase against Sri Lanka yesterday.“It was a very good chase. 215 by any team against any team is a great effort. It leaves the tournament wide open,” said Unadkat.On his India comeback, he added: “I was waiting for this opportunity ever since I started playing the game. These are exciting times for me. I have tried to do as well as I could and the next few months will be about how I can improve further.”', 'New Delhi: Young Akhil Sheoran clinched the gold medal in the men’s 50m rifle 3 position as India continued their superlative run at the ISSF World Cup in Guadalajara, Mexico.Sheoran thus became the fourth young Indian shooter to win a medal on ISSF World Cup debut. This was after the likes of Shahzar Rizvi, Manu Bhaker, Mehuli Ghosh and Anjum Moudgil had put India on top of the medal standings with their performances over the last week.Sheoran’s gold was India’s fourth of the competition and makes it almost certain that the country would finish on top of the medals tally for the first time in an ISSF World Cup.Sheoran shot 455.6 in the final ahead of Austria’s Bernhard Pickl, who finished second with 452.In a strong field that included 38-time ISSF medallist and Hungarian rifle legend Peter Sidi, Rio Olympic bronze medallist Alexis Reynauld of France and air rifle gold medallist Istvan Peni, also of Hungary besides India’s champion 3 position exponent Sanjeev Rajput, Sheoran’s performance in tough conditions belied his age and experience.Earlier in the qualification round where each shooter has 40 shots in each position, the experienced Rajput shot a solid 1176 out of a possible 1200 to qualify second behind Peni (1178).Sheoran was fourth with 1174 while young Swapnil Kusale, competing in his first World Cup, shot 1168 for seventh place to ensure all three Indians made the eight-man final.Rajput had the best prone round among all qualifiers with a 398 out of 400 while both he and Sheoran had the strongest kneeling round among the eight with scores of 392 each.Swapnil had the strongest standing round among the three Indians with a 390 score which was the second best in the position among all qualifiers.In the final, Rajput was strongest off the blocks and was placed second after the first 10 kneeling shots with Sheoran in third and Swapnil in joint fourth place.At the end of it, Rajput was 0.6 clear of Pickl.

The tennis stalwart has been named in India’s squad for next month’s Asia/Oceania Group I tie against China to be played in Tianjin.Paes was dropped from the tie against Uzbekistan in April 2017 and was also not considered for the World Group Play-off against Canada. “Doors were never closed on Paes. Our main aim was to choose the best team and earlier we could only choose a four-member team so we went with three singles and a doubles player but now we can name five. So we selected three singles and two doubles specialists,” Zeeshan Ali, the All India Tennis Association selection committee member said after a meeting held here on Sunday.Yuki Bhambri, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Sumit Nagal and Rohan Bopanna are other members of the team while Divij Sharan has been kept in reserve.“The team selection was based on current form and rankings. Bopanna is the highest ranked doubles player while Paes is two rung below Divij. But in Davis Cup, Paes is the most experienced player and he reached the Dubai Championship final last week… so we gave preference to him and kept Divij as reserve,” said Ali, who is also the team coach.‘Paes, Bopanna best doubles combination’\\nAsked on Bopanna’s reluctance to pair up with Paes, Zeeshan said, “They should definitely put their personal differences aside and put their best foot forward for the country. At the end of the day, they are playing for the country.“Paes and Bopanna will be the best doubles combination that we have.”Zeeshan also said that by calling up Nagal, the selectors want to give a chance to young players to gain experience.“Ram and Yuki are playing best tennis of their career and are consistent. Nagal is the third highest singles player in the country and he has done well last year. We want to promote young players in the team and it will be a great experience for him. Definitely, he earned his place in the team.”Nagal and Ramkumar have already reached China to play Challengers and Yuki will join them soon and it will help the team to acclimatise well with the conditions there.“On paper, we are a good team but in Davis Cup rankings do not matter much. Playing China in China will be tough. Last time we played against them it was a very close match as we won 3-2. They have good players and have home advantage as well.“According to a new rule, the matches will be played across two days instead of three and China have advantage of playing in the new format. So we will see how well we will adapt to the new situation. This will be another challenge for us,” the Davis Cupper said.

The spunky student screamed at him and threatened to lodge a complaint, which finally deterred him. Despite the awareness about sexual harassment on campuses, two weeks ago during Holi, when a student of the Delhi University was hit by a semen-filled balloon, following protests, perverts continue to threaten women. Priya described the incident to Deccan Chronicle: “While returning to ladies hostel around 1.30 am, I was accompanied by a friend for some time. But, after I continued to walk alone, I heard footsteps. When I turned back, I was shocked to see a man unzipping his pants just to bring his genitals out. Giving him benefit of the doubt, I continued to walk while he continued to follow me. I turned back again only to see him masturbating this time.”The man was not known to Priya. She decided to take matters into her own hands and screamed at the man, saying that she would file a GS-Cash complaint i.e. a complaint with the student-run gender sensitisation committee in the UoH.\\nWhen the man hesitated and didn’t continue the act, she screamed even louder asking him to face her if he was bold enough to, which caused the man to flee.\\nPriya took it to social media to share the incident openly. “I did not file a complaint with the GS-Cash committee because then they will make it confidential. People must to know what happened to me so that they know that our campus is not safe anymore.”Priya’s post on Facebook got a lot of attention, particularly from students who claimed to have faced similar situations. One comment read: “There have been instances of creeps masturbating right outside the ladies hostel in the north campus.”Many students commended Priya’s courage in questioning the man as he might now think twice before doing this again.

Mr Singh was told that the bar had a “no headwear” policy.He tried to explain to a bouncer who approached him that the turban protected his hair and was part of his religion. But his pleas were ignored – and he was “dragged away” from his friends before being removed from the venue, the report said.Mr Singh was also allegedly told, “I didn’t think you were allowed to come in a pub and drink anyway.”“I’m heartbroken. The reason why I was removed was because I refused to remove my turban,” he wrote on Facebook.Mr Singh said the bouncer had approached him saying that he needed to remove his turban, the report said. “I explained that a turban isn’t just headgear, but part of my religion and that it protected my hair – and that I was allowed to wear a turban in public,” he said.“The bouncer ignored this and said I needed to take it off. I refused and was subsequently dragged away from my friends,” he added.“The fact that I was being removed because of my religious views really upset me.

It is hardly worth saying that we will not allow this, to put it mildly,” he added.Netanyahu has been a vocal opponent of the nuclear deal signed in 2015 between Iran and the six world powers in order to limit Tehran’s nuclear plan and prevent it from achieving atomic weapons.In January, Trump announced that he will waive sanctions against Iran and extend the nuclear deal after he disavowed the deal three months earlier.Israel is widely believed to hold hundreds of nuclear warheads, which the country has never officially acknowledged to exist.', 'Srinagar: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday raided the central jail here and seized over two dozen mobile phones, jihadi literature and a Pakistani flag apart from data hardware, an official spokesperson said.At least 20 teams of the central probe agency, with commandos of the NSG and drones in tow, searched the barracks and open ground of the high-security prison that houses some of the most wanted and dreaded terrorists, including those from Pakistan.The searches, the spokesperson said, were carried out in connection with an investigation over the arrest of two youths in Kupwara — Danish Ghulam Lone and Sohail Ahmed Bhat.The two youths had claimed that the fresh recruits of Al-Badr, a proscribed terrorist organisation, were being sent across for arms training in furtherance of a conspiracy hatched from inside the Central Jail, Srinagar.The searches started early morning and continued till late afternoon during which all the barracks and the open ground were thoroughly searched with the help of well-trained teams and deep search metal detectors.A close watch was kept on the entire operation with the help of drones, the spokesperson said.During the search, 25 mobile phones, some SIM cards, 5 secure digital cards, 5 pen drives, one iPod and large number of documents and articles, including a poster of Hizbul Mujahideen, a Pakistani flag besides jihadi literature, were seized, he said.The agency is also probing the escape of dreaded Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Mohammed Naveed Jhatt on February 6 from a busy hospital in Srinagar. It is believed that the conspiracy of his escape was hatched in the Srinagar central jail.The spokesman said that the teams were accompanied by magistrates, witnesses and doctors. ', 'NEW DELHI: Nearly 40,000 to 50,000 people, members of various Railway unions, are holding a protest march to Parliament in the national capital on Tuesday. The unions are demanding the withdrawal of the National Pension System (NPS) and improvement of minimum wages.The unions are also demanding a hike in minimum pay to Rs 26,000 from the current Rs 18,000.“Under the NPS, the defined minimum pension or family pension is no more guaranteed for those employees who came in government service on or after 2004, although they are regularly contributing 10 per cent of their wages every month towards this scheme,” said Shiv Gopal Mishra, general secretary of All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) at a press conference.Railwaymen from all across the country are participating in the protest. However, the union assured that no rail services will be disrupted and select few employees will continue to man the services. “We have given instructions that no trains will be stopped or delayed because of our march. However, there will be a lot of absentees. Most of those affected are youngsters and they are very upset and angry,” said Mishra.In February 2016, the AIRF had conducted a secret ballot for its members to decide the future course of action if its demands weren’t met. Ninety-five per cent of the 9,00,000 railwaymen who voted supported a strike. These employees included railway men from across the country, including 17 zones and seven production units of the Indian Railways.Mishra said while social security to retired government employees was achieved after a prolonged struggle, it was virtually withdrawn with the introduction of the NPS from January 2004.The demand to scrap the NPS was one of the main demands made by the central government employees last year. A three-member committee of ministers headed by Home Minister Rajnath Singh was formed to discuss the grievances but there was no progress.“There is anger and anguish not just among railwaymen, but also among bureaucrats, over this. We have been assured again and again that our demands will be met, but nothing has happened so far. If they do not relent, then we will have to stick together and the next step could well be disruptive,” Mishra said.In 1974, railway employees demanding a wage increase staged a strike that crippled life in the country for almost three weeks.

For many, the Oscars not only stands for celebrating the best of Hollywood, but also for setting fashion goals and beauty trends. The 90th Academy Awards ceremony was held on March 4 in Los Angeles. Shabana had earlier expressed her views on the red carpet. “What bothers me about red carpet, particularly Cannes, is that it’s an extremely important festival where stunning films are shown and nothing of that ever comes in papers.

The sportscar will be the company’s final Aero model and only eight units of the special GT variant will be built.It will also be the last car to use BMW’s long-standing N62 V8 engine. Having powered Morgan’s Aero since it launched in 2000, the naturally aspirated 4.8-litre unit, which hasn’t been used in a BMW since 2010, will also bow out in its most potent form.Producing 372hp and 490Nm of torque, the V8 is linked to a BMW six-speed manual gearbox that delivers drive to the rear wheels. It can accelerate the 1,182kg Aero GT to 100kph in 4.5sec and a top speed of 273kph.The bespoke variant gets aggressive aerodynamic features inspired by Morgan’s 2009 GT3 racing car. Most noticeable of which is the larger rear diffuser that’s said to lower pressure at the rear to push the car into the ground at speed. There are also several other smaller aerodynamic parts, including a pair of canards on the nose and extra louvre vents, that help to reduce air pressure over the body. Every panel is sculpted by hand.The car retains the Aero 8’s aluminium chassis and adjustable suspension, but gains the option of a carbonfibre hard top in place of the standard soft top.

It is also considered essential for reducing the risk of most coronary heart diseases and brain development problems.Another study by scientists at South Dakota State University in the US found that canola oil reduced the size and incidence of colon tumors in rats.“This is the first time anyone has done work on the effect of canola oil in animals on colon cancer prevention. Canola oil was able to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animals almost to one-third,” said Chandradhar Dwivedi, who led the study.The findings, published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer, suggested that using canola oil in household cooking may protect against colon cancer development.', 'Mumbai: With increasing incidents of large scale cyber-attacks and governmental cyber espionage, the demand for professionals in the segment has gone up three time in past 12 months, according to a report.“As companies seek to bolster their defence against data security breaches, the demand for cyber security experts in India has outstripped supply of these professionals by three times over the past 12 months,” according to a report by an outbound recruitment solution Belong.This demand trend is likely to grow faster going forward with the rise in use of Internet and e-commerce and customer awareness on cyber security, Belong Co-founder Rishabh Kaul told news agency Press Trust of India.The Belong research is based on data from postings by companies needing cyber professional on multiple platforms for a period of 12 months.The report said, organisations are going on a hiring spree to secure their data and systems, and the demand for cyber security professionals is in both tech as well as non-tech companies.According to the research, currently, there are 10,000-15,000 open jobs related to cyber security across tech and non-tech roles in India.The bulk of the demand of hiring is triggered by the the technology and banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sectors, the report added.Further, the report also revealed that within the technology sector, the demand is spread between ITeS (25 percent), software product (non-security) or shared services or captives (24 percent) and security companies (9 percent), it said.The bulk of the demand is likely to be in the top 10 IT hubs in the country, including Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune among others, Kaul said.The demand for cyber security professionals is all across, but the majority of these openings is for the fresher level, he said.“With the demand escalating, there may also be rise a in expats hiring, especially for the mid-level or senior level roles where experience is needed.There is also a possibility of companies hiring senior level professional, who will be based from some other country, to lead a team here in the country,” Kaul added.Currently, most companies are struggling by either giving more responsibilities to their mid-senior level executives or depending on third-party players, he said.With technology changing fast, many companies have begun focusing on cyber security and getting involved in training talent to reduce this demand-supply gap, he added.(With PTI inputs)', 'New Delhi: Bollywood actresses are often seen vying for the same role in big banner ventures.

The messaging platform increased the limit from 420 seconds (or seven minutes) as part of WhatsApp beta for Android version 2.18.69.The extension of the time limit was also made available later on iOS and Windows Phone updates. However, some users have already taken advantage of the ‘Delete for Everyone’ feature via modded versions of the app to delete messages dating back to three years. WhatsApp users can understand that a message has been deleted with the “This message has been deleted” prompt in their chat window. Those using modded or unauthorized versions of the app have tricked this notification system to delete old messages.Now, WhatsApp has silently added another feature called ‘Block revoke request’ in order to stop users from exploiting the ‘Delete for Everyone’ feature. According to WABetaInfo report, the feature works by sending a message to the recipient whenever the sender tries to delete a message for everyone. This message has the same ID as the one the user wants to delete.WhatsApp then finds a message in the database having the same ID and matches it with that of the message requested to be revoked by the sender. It then checks the date related information of the message saved in the database. The algorithm has been programmed to perform the delete operation only if the current date is less than 24 hours of the date of the saved message. This will ensure that nobody can fool the system to delete messages for everyone dating back to three years.With this new addition, WhatsApp is sticking to 24 hours as a reference time period in order to ensure that the recipient or recipients in case of group chat have ample time to receive the revoke request. The update is a step to curb exploitation of a feature that was deemed useful by those using the platform.', 'NEW DELHI: Shortly after joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), former Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agrawal on Monday hit out at actor-turned-politician Jaya Bachchan for getting a ticket for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections, slated to be held on March 23.“Films mein kaam karne wali se meri hesiyat kardi gayi, unke naam par humara ticket kataa gaya, maine isko bhi bahut utchit nahi samjha. Meri koi shart par nahi aya, koi Rajya Sabka ki ticket ki maang nahi hai (I was put at par with a film actor. My ticket was given to her. I have not come (to BJP) on any condition. I do not want a ticket to Rajya Sabha),” he said.In a jolt to the Samajwadi party, senior leader Naresh Agrawal joined the BJP in the presence of Union minister Piyush Goyal.Agrawal, who earlier was the general secretary of the Samajwadi Party and a Rajya Sabha member, was reportedly unhappy with the party president and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for giving the Rajya Sabha ticket to Jaya Bachchan.Last week, Jaya Bachchan was picked as the Samajwadi Party nominee for the Rajya Sabha elections from the state of Uttar Pradesh.Calling Bachchan a loyal leader, Rajya Sabha MP Amar Singh had said that she deserves to be the Samajwadi Party’s candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls.Bachchan was chosen over Naresh Agrawal who has served as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Hardoi constituency seven times.“Naresh Aggarwal has joined many parties. He started his career in Congress. He was a member of the cabinet of Rajnath Singh. Then intermittently he was in Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and then he came in Samajwadi Party. He is widely experienced,” Singh had said.“So far Jaya Bachchan is concerned, she was consistently loyal to the Samajwadi Party and to the party`s system. She has been loyal to the hierarchy of the SP. So she has proven to be a better politician than Naresh Aggarwal,” he hag added.Bachchan is a three-time MP and was first elected to the Upper House by the Samajwadi Party in 2004 until March 2006.

The report, exclusively accessed by DNA, states that investigators knew the answer as to who killed Sunanda Pushkar from the beginning yet her death has been kept a mystery till today.Here is what the DNA report says in connection with Sunanda Pushkar death case.According to the first report prepared in the case by the then Deputy Commissioner of Police BS Jaiswal, it clearly states that the Sub Divisional Magistrate at Vasant Vihar Alok Sharma, who inspected the place of crime at Leela Hotel and conducted the inquest proceeding, was of the view that it was not a suicide. The report, exclusively accessed by DNA, states unsatisfied with the inquest proceedings, Sub Divisional Magistrate had ordered the Station House Officer of Sarojini Nagar to investigate the case as murder.The decision was made when the autopsy report stated,”The cause of death to the best of my knowledge and belief, in this case, is poisoning. The circumstantial evidenced are suggestive of alprazolam poisoning. All the injuries mentioned are caused by blunt force, simple in nature, non-contributing to death and are produced in a scuffle, except injury number 10 with an injection mark. Injury number 12 is teeth bite mark. The injuries number 1 to 15 is of various durations ranging from 12 hours to 4 days.” The report clearly stated that the injection marks were fresh.The report also states the body of Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor had various scuffle marks. “These seem to have caused due to a scuffle between Sunanda Pushkar and her Husband Shashi Tharoor as per the statement of their personal attendant Narain Singh,” said the report which was submitted to then Southern Delhi range Joint Commissioner of Police Vivek Gogia, who was given a task to personally monitor the case. The report was further submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs.Even after the cause of the death was found, the police did not file a case into the matter. And when the matter was transferred to crime branch after a week and decided to file an FIR of murder and start the probe, Gogia managed to get the case back within four hours from crime branch. The Crime Branch had also visited that crime spot when the murder took place. The decision of the then Commissioner of Police BS Bassi led to delay in registration of FIR in the case for a year and investigation for almost two years.The secret report had all the annexure, which included, post-mortem, chemical,  biological fingerprints reports – accessed by DNA — separately and each report pointed towards murder yet the police did not registered a case.Interestingly, the report questioned the teeth bite marks of the hand of the Pushkar and also the injection mark on her hand. “Whether poisoned was orally given or injected is a matter to be probed,” the report stated.On January 17, 2014, at about 9 pm police came to know that Sunanda Pushkar has died in Room Number 345, which is a suite, at Hotel Leela Palace. Preliminary enquiries stated that she had checked in to this hotel on January 15, 2014, at 5: 46 pm. The room number 307 was earlier given to her, later on, she moved to Room number 345 in the afternoon on January 16, 1 2014.Also, the crime branch sleuths and journalist Nalini Singh stated that Sunanda wanted to a presser. At 3 pm, she had asked her assistant to take out her white dress as she wanted to do a press conference. Next thing happened, she was found dead. The question remained the same. Who killed the socialite Sunanda Puskhar. Since the deceased had died within seven years of her marriage, the SDM Alok Sharma was informed who inspected the place of crime and conducted the inquest proceedings.“The death was mysterious and everything pointed out towards murder from day one,” said a senior police officer who was then investigating the case said.', 'New Delhi: An all-party meeting to discuss the ceiling drive in the capital will take place at Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Tuesday. This after the Delhi Chief Minister sent out invites to members of all parties – including Congress’Ajay Maken and BJP’s Manoj Tiwari.The ceiling of shops in the city has led to a political war of words even as traders claim mounting loses and threaten to strike. While Kejriwal previously assured them of all help and even wrote to PM Narendra Modi, he has now called for an all-party meeting in a letter which read that ‘there is a need for us to rise above party lines to find a solution to the sealing issue.’ He has also requested that only three members of each party attend the meeting ‘so that we can come to a fruitful solution.’In his letter to Maken specifically, Kejriwal wrote that since the Congress leader has been a minister for Urban Development, he is sure of getting good and practical suggestions on the issue from him. “I assure you from my side that my party and government will do whatever is needed to put an end to sealing and to reopen shops that have already been sealed,” wrote the Delhi Chief Minister.Kejriwal has previously lashed out at the Centre for not doing justice to the shopkeepers, claiming that they are facing the brunt of the Centre’s faults. “The reason behind sealing is anomalies in the law. It is the responsibility of the Central government to remove these anomalies. However, the government has not done anything and the shopkeepers are paying the price for it,” the Chief Minister wrote in a strongly-worded letter to the PM.He appealed to the PM asking for a law to be made against the sealing drive so that the shopkeepers do not face any more harm. “There is only one solution now. A bill has to be brought in Parliament to remove anomalies in the law and save traders from unemployment,” he said.', 'KL Rahul made a dubious distinction during the fourth game of the Nidahas T20I tri-series in Colombo on Monday as he became the first Indian to get out hit-wicket in the shortest format of the game. Rahul (18) played back to a Jeeven Mendis delivery in the 10th over looking for a single on the legside when his back foot disrupted the stumps. Rahul and Manish Pandey had added 23 runs for the fourth wicket when this uncommon incident happened. Only nine players before had got out in that fashion in T20Is. Incidentally, Rahul had returned to India’s playing XI replacing the out-of-form Rishabh Pant and desperately needed a solid innings to stake a claim for a regular berth in India’s T20I team. Alas, his quest ended in one of the most unfortunate manners. Earlier in the day after rain reduced the match to 19 overs per side and Rohit Sharma elected to bowl, medium pacer Shardul Thakur picked up a career-best 4/27, including back-to-back wickets in the last over, to help India restict the hosts to 152/9.The Lankans were at one time on course for a big score at 96/2 in 10.3 overs when Vijay Shankar removed Upul Tharanga for 22. The complexion of the Sri Lankan innings changed in the blink of an eye thereafter. The 62-run third-wicket stand between Kusal Mendis (55 off 38 balls) and Tharanga had given the hosts a lot of hope but with the departure of Tharanga the Indian bowlers got back in charge of the proceedings. Sri Lanka, who were playing in this match without their regular captain Dinesh Chandimal, suspended on account of a slow over-rate offence against Bangladesh in Match 3, had Dasun Shanaka’s 19 off 16 balls plenty to thank for taking them past the 150-run mark. Washington Sundar was the second best Indian bowler on the evening as he returned 2/21 in his four overs. Jaydev Unadkat, Yuzvendra Chahal and Shankar took one wicket each.

Rescuers had to cut apart the mangled and burned wreckage of the aircraft to pull people out.“Thirty-one people died at the spot and nine died at two hospitals in Kathmandu,” police spokesman Manoj Neupane said, adding another 23 were injured.The cause of the crash was not immediately clear, but a statement from airport authorities said the plane was “out of control” as it came in to land.Eye witnesses said the plane crashed as it made a second attempt to land.Nepal Army spokesman Gokul Bhandaree said seven of the victims had survived the impact but later died of their injuries.Plumes of black smoke could be seen rising from the football pitch where the plane crashed, to the east of the runway at Nepal’s only international airport, in the capital Kathmandu.Airline spokesman Kamrul Islam, said 33 of the passengers were Nepali, 32 were Bangladeshi, one was Chinese and one from the Maldives.The plane was a Canadian-made Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop, Mahbubur Rahman of Bangladesh’s civil aviation ministry said. Other sources said the aircraft was 17 years old.“There might be technical problems on the aircraft. But it has to be probed before making a final statement,” Rahman said.Kathmandu briefly closed after the accident, forcing inbound flights to divert, but it has since reopened.US-Bangla Airlines is a private carrier that launched in July 2014 with the motto “Fly Fast Fly Safe”, according to its website.The Dhaka-based airline made its first international flight in May 2016 to Kathmandu, and has since expanded with routes to South Asia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.In 2015 one of its planes overshot the runway on landing at Saidpur in northwest Bangladesh. There were no reports of injuries.Nepal has suffered a number of air disasters in recent years, dealing a blow to its tourist industry.Its poor air safety record has been blamed largely on inadequate maintenance, inexperienced pilots and substandard management.In early 2016, a Twin Otter turboprop aircraft slammed into a mountainside in Nepal killing all 23 people on board.Two days later, two pilots were killed when a small passenger plane crash-landed in the country’s hilly midwest.', 'New York:\\xa0Five people have died after a helicopter owned by a tour group plunged into Manhattan’s East River, police said on Monday.The red chopper, which is owned by tourism group Liberty, was carrying six people including the pilot when it crashed into the river near the upscale Upper East Side neighbourhood shortly after 7:00 pm (2300 GMT) on Sunday.“Five people are deceased,” a New York Police Department spokesperson said, saying the dead were all passengers on the helicopter.Following the crash, “the pilot freed himself, the other five did not,” Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters during an earlier press conference.Divers rushed to the scene and freed the passengers, two of whom were pronounced dead, while three others were taken to hospital in critical condition, Nigro said.“We are told the five people were all tied tightly in harnesses that had to be cut and removed,” he said.Liberty organizes aerial tours of America’s financial capital.

The government sought six months time from the farmers to fulfil their demands, including right to till forestland, as thousands of farmers converged here in a sea of red.Under pressure from the opposition and ally Shiv Sena, the BJP-led Maharashtra government on Monday accepted the demands of agitating farmers, including their right to till forest land, as thousands of agriculturists converged here in a sea of red. In a major victory for the farmers who trekked 180 km from Nashik to here over six days under the blazing sun, some even barefooted, the state’s revenue minister Chandrakant patil said their “all demands” are being accepted. He was addressing farmers camping at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai in the presence of CPI-M general secretary Sitaram Yechury. Talking to reporters outside Vidhan Bhawan, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “We have agreed to set up a committee to hand over forest land used for farming, to tribals and farmers.” “A meeting was held with representatives of farmers and adivasis at Vidhan Bhawan on Monday. We have agreed to set up a committee to allot agricultural land to tribals provided they submit a proof of pre-2005 land cultivation. We have accepted almost all their demands,” the CM said.\\nEarlier in the day, Fadnavis, who was under intense pressure to concede the demands of farmers, had said his government was “sensitive and positive” towards their issues. “Around 90 to 95 per cent of the participants are poor tribals. They are fighting for forest land rights. They are landless and can’t do farming. The government is sensitive and positive towards their demands,” he said.', 'India has emerged as the largest importer of major arms according to a latest research released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published on Monday. According to the study, India became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2013-17 accounting for 12 per cent of the total global import.The study said that there has been significant increase of 24 per cent in India’s weapon import between 2008-12 and 2013-17. The country that accounts for the maximum arms import of India is Russia with 62 per cent.However, the rise in arms import from the US has been significant during the 2013-17 period. Imports from the country increased by as much as 557 per cent, making America the second largest arms supplier to India.About Pakistan, the report said that the country’s arms imports went down by 36 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17. The study said, “Pakistan accounted for 2.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2013–17. Its arms imports from the USA dropped by 76 per cent in 2013–17 compared with 2008–12.”According to Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme, the tension in recent past with both Pakistan and China have led to the increase in growing demands of weapon, which India does not produce itself.The study further said that China has increasingly been becoming capable of producing its own weapons, and maintaining itself as a supplier in the region by maintaining good relations with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar.The US emerged as the world’s top exporter of weapons accounting for 34 per cent of global arms sales in the last five years, according to the study. Russia accounted for 20 per cent of the export ranking second in the list. The US share of arms sales has gone up from 30 per cent recorded in the 2008-12 period.', 'Geneva: UN human rights experts investigating a possible genocide in Myanmar said on Monday that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.Facebook had no immediate comment on the criticism on Monday, although in the past the company has said that it was working to remove hate speech in Myanmar and kick off people who shared such content consistently.More than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar`s Rakhine state into Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown last August. Many have provided harrowing testimonies of executions and rapes by Myanmar security forces.The UN human rights chief said last week he strongly suspected acts of genocide had taken place. Myanmar`s national security adviser demanded “clear evidence”.Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, told reporters that social media had played a “determining role” in Myanmar. “It has … substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissention and conflict, if you will, within the public. Hate speech is certainly of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media,” he said. UN Myanmar investigator Yanghee Lee said Facebook was a huge part of public, civil and private life, and the government used it to disseminate information to the public.“Everything is done through Facebook in Myanmar,” she told reporters, adding that Facebook had helped the impoverished country but had also been used to spread hate speech.“It was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities,” she said.“I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended.”The most prominent of Myanmar’s hard-line nationalist monks, Wirathu, emerged from a one-year preaching ban on Saturday and said his anti-Muslim rhetoric had nothing to do with violence in Rakhine state.Facebook suspends and sometimes removes anyone that “consistently shares content promoting hate”, the company said last month in response to a question about Wirathu’s account.“If a person consistently shares content promoting hate, we may take a range of actions such as temporarily suspending their ability to post and ultimately, removal of their account.”', 'Washington/Seoul:The White House said on Monday it fully expects an unprecedented meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to take place, if North Korea sticks to its promises, even though Pyongyang has yet to comment publicly on the possibility of a summit.A South Korean delegation that visited North Korea last week said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed a wish to meet Trump and South Korea`s president to discuss denuclearisation. North Korean media has reported the South Korean visit, but no details of the talks.Asked if the North Korean silence meant there was a chance the meeting between Trump and Kim would not take place, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said:“We fully expect that it will. The offer was made and we’ve accepted. North Korea made several promises and we hope that they would stick to those promises and if so the meeting will go on as planned.“We are continuing to prepare on a number of levels,” she told a regular briefing.Earlier, South Korea said North Korea`s silence on summits with both the United States and South Korea was probably due to caution in preparing for the meetings, while U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington expected to hear directly from Pyongyang.“We have not seen nor received an official response from the North Korean regime regarding the North Korea-U.S. summit,” said Baik Tae-hyun, spokesman for South Korea`s Unification ministry.“I feel they`re approaching this matter with caution and they need time to organise their stance.” Tillerson said several steps would be necessary to agree the location and scope of the talks.“It`s very early stages. We`ve not heard anything directly back from North Korea but we expect to hear something directly from them,” he said during a visit to Nigeria.Tillerson, who has cut short his first trip to Africa as secretary of state to return to Washington on Tuesday, a day ahead of schedule, did not elaborate.In an unexpected move last week, Trump agreed to hold a first-ever meeting with Kim, which South Korea said would take place by the end of May after a North-South summit in April.News of possible talks has been a dramatic turnaround from fears of war over North Korea`s development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.Trump made the announcement after the head of a South Korean delegation that met Kim last week said the North Korean leader had committed to denuclearisation and pledged to refrain from nuclear and missile tests.Asked in a Fox News interview due to air on Monday evening whether there was a real possibility of North Korea denuclearizing, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said: “We`ll see, as the president often says.” But Pence called Kim`s offers to cease missile and nuclear testing while not objecting to U.S.-South Korean military exercises “a remarkable step forward” and a result of Trump`s tough approach.“He`s marshalled unprecedented economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime in North Korea and this breakthrough – and we hope it is a breakthrough – is a result of the strong leadership the president has provided on the world stage,” Pence said.Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in will meet at the truce village of Panmunjom straddling the Korean border, but a venue for the North Korea-US summit has yet to be decided.CHINA URGES PATIENCE The South Korean officials who met Kim travelled to Washington last week to relay his message and visited China on Monday to brief President Xi Jinping, who urged patience.South Korea`s National Security Office chief, Chung Eui-yong, who led the delegation to Pyongyang, will head to Russia on Tuesday, while spy agency chief Suh Hoon met Japan`s foreign minister in Tokyo, where he is to speak with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday.In Beijing on Monday, Xi told Chung there was an important opportunity for talks.“At the same time, all sides must exercise patience and be attentive, and show political wisdom, to appropriately face and dispel any problems and interference to resuming the talks process,” state media cited Xi as saying.Xi said China looked forward to smooth talks between the two Koreas and between the United States and North Korea and substantive progress in the denuclearisation process and normalisation of ties.Tensions eased as the Koreas held talks against the backdrop of the Winter Olympics in South Korea last month but Japan has expressed scepticism and warned that “talks for the sake of talks” would be unacceptable.Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said after talks with Suh Hoon that Tokyo and Seoul agreed that maximum pressure must be maintained on North Korea until it takes concrete action to address concerns about its weapons programmes.Kono declined to say what that action should be, but South Korea`s presidential Blue House quoted him as saying that the breakthrough on talks with North Korea was a near “miracle”.In Geneva, the U.N. investigator on North Korea told the world body`s Human Rights Council that any progress in the nuclear and security dialogue must be accompanied by talks on human rights violations, including political prison camps.“Let me urge the DPRK to consolidate this rapprochement with a parallel opening to human rights review,” said Tomas Ojea Quintana, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People`s Republic of Korea.North Korea`s state media has lauded the thaw in relations with South Korea. It has continued to warn the United States and Japan against war-mongering but its rhetoric has been tame compared with threats exchanged at the height of tensions last year.', 'New Delhi: Air India One is expected to be fully upgraded, customised and put into service by 2020. This after senior government officials said that new planes – Boeing 777s – for the President, Vice-President and Prime Minister are receiving the upgrades as per schedule.Air India inducted three Boeing 777s in February and March of 2017 and these are now being retrofitted with features, conveniences and security systems which are mandatory for flying the top three top-ranking political figures in the country. Two of the three 777s are being upgraded with a VIP enclosure, press conference room and a patient transport unit for medical emergencies. The aircraft will also have WiFi on board and would be equipped with top-notch anti-missile systems, radar-dodging mechanics and other security features. However, the biggest difference between the new 777s and the Boeing 747s which are currently in service to transport VVIPs is that the new planes can fly non-stop to the United States – mitigating the need for refuelling halts. Cutting-edge communication systems, in-flight kitchen and a personal room for the VVIP is also expected. Powering the plane are two GE90-115BL engines – considered the most powerful of all aircraft engines in the world.A senior government official also revealed that the government will buy these planes from Air India once they are completely upgraded and deemed ready for service.', 'Sydney: People suffering from schizophrenia may now possibly benefit from the effective, sensitive and tailored treatments used to treat victims of childhood abuse, researchers have claimed.The study associated a link between the sexual, physical and emotional abuse experienced during the childhood and the severity of symptoms such as detachment from reality, hallucinations, delusions, disorganised thinking, and lack of motivation or emotions in schizophrenic patients and other psychotic disorders.The meta-analysis, published in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin, which analysed 29 studies on childhood trauma and psychotic symptoms, found that childhood sexual abuse was associated with delusions.In addition, hallucinations in those with psychotic disorders were associated with all types of childhood trauma.“This means there is something about childhood trauma that leads some people to develop hallucinations,” said lead author Sarah Bendall, research fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia.Researchers added that around one in every 100 people will experience a psychotic disorder in their lives, with the majority developing symptoms between 18 to 25 years old.Until now, treatments for trauma in psychosis focused on post-traumatic stress disorder rather than specific symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.But this research not only helps in refine treatments for patients with psychotic disorders, it may also help to empower young patients.“When young people come to youth mental health services, we should be assessing for trauma and for emerging psychotic symptoms, and treating them as soon as they emerge,” she said.“We can also arm young people with some of this research knowledge and then they can make decisions about the factors that may have caused their psychosis to develop or continue. It’s a very empowering thing to be able to give people that information,” the researcher said. ', 'Mumbai: Telugu actor Nikhil Siddharth who is looking forward to the release of his film Kirrak Party, recently ended up saying that he had once asked his co-star Samyuktha Hegde to shut up while shooting for the film.According to reports, Nikhil revealed about the incident during an interview and tried to cover it up later.Samyuktha was apparently giving directions like a director on the microphone on the sets of the film and this apparently irked Nikhil. He was reportedly irritated by her behavior and hence he asked everyone on the sets expect filmmaker Sharan Koppisetty and the cameraman Advaitha Gurumurthy to shut up.Nikhil also said that it is easier to work with Simran Pareenja, who is also a part of the film. She is calm unlike Samyuktha who is bubbly and energetic.According to a mirchi9.com report, Nikhil said that the first half of Kirrak Party, will be like Pawan Kalyan starrer Kushi while the second half will be like Nagarjuna’s Shiva.Kirrak Party is the official remake of Rishab Shetty’s Kannada movie Kirik Party which released in 2016.Nikhil also reportedly said that the film has only taken the soul from the original Kannada film and the story has been rewritten.B Ajaneesh Loknath has composed the music for the film which is slated to release on March 16.', 'New Delhi: A few days after a clip featuring Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter was leaked online, producer Karan Johar and director Shashank Khaitan have issued a no-phone-policy on the set to curb further leaks, reports mid-day.As per the reports, the crew members will now reportedly hand over their phones before entering the set. “When the team found out about the leaked videos on Saturday night, it promptly reached out to Instagram Help Center and managed to pull one of them down. But it was too late to block the other one, as it had been circulated widely by Janhvi and Ishaan’s fan clubs by then. The video was from the Jaipur schedule of Dhadak that took place a few months ago,” a source from Karan Johar’s Dharma productions told mid-day.About this whole issue, Shashank Khaitan told mid-day, “It’s unfortunate that people leak footage. We can only do so much to protect our product, but with outdoor schedules, it is difficult for us. Everyone around has a camera phone. Kis kis ko roke? It would be nice if people were more supportive.”The mid-day report further stated that in the leaked clips, which were circulated on the social media, Janhvi and Ishaan were seen shooting near a river bank. The other one featured only Janhvi in a green sari. She resumed shooting for Dhadak post her 21st birthday.‘Dhadak’ is a remake of Marathi film ‘Sairat’, which released in 2016.“Since the film is a remake of Sairat, the plot is already known. So, it is crucial for Shashank to guard the film’s look to keep the mystery around the movie alive. Since many scenes are being shot outdoors, the producers are working on procuring permissions to cordon off the area where they are shooting. After all, the videos in question were leaked by the fans who had queued up on set,” a source from the crew unit told mid-day.‘Dhadak’ is Janhvi Kapoor’s debut film and it is slated to hit the theatres in July.', 'Manish Pandey and Dinesh Karthik added an unbeaten 68 for the fifth wicket to help India register their second win in the Nidahas T20I tri-series in Colombo on Monday. Chasing 153 to win in 19 overs, India were in a spot of bother at 85/4 in the 10th over but Pandey (42) and Karthik (39) battted with conviction to dissipate all doubts as the Indians avenged their defeat in the opening game of the tri-series on March 6.  India started badly and by the end of the fourth over of their chase they were two wickets down with Rohit Sharma (11) and the in-form Shikhar Dhawan (8) back in the dug-out. Suresh Raina looked good during his stay but couldn’t go beyond 27 runs.And then KL Rahul (18) got out in one of the most unfortunate manners as he became the first Indian to get out hit-wicket in the shortest format of the game. Rahul played back to a Jeeven Mendis delivery looking for a single on the legside when his back foot disrupted the stumps. Rahul and Pandey had added 23 runs for the fourth wicket when this uncommon incident happened.Only nine players before had got out in that fashion in T20Is. At the time of Rahul’s departure, things looked gloomy in the Indian camp and another defeat against Sri Lanka stared them in the face. But Pandey and Karthik had other ideas and batted convincingly to take the team home in 17.3 overs with six wickets in hand. Earlier in the day, after rain reduced the match to 19 overs per side and Rohit elected to bowl, medium pacer Shardul Thakur picked up a career-best 4/27, including back-to-back wickets in the last over, to help India restict the hosts to 152/9.The Lankans were at one time on course for a big score at 96/2 in 10.3 overs when Vijay Shankar removed Upul Tharanga for 22. The complexion of the Sri Lankan innings changed in the blink of an eye thereafter. The 62-run third-wicket stand between Kusal Mendis (55 off 38 balls) and Tharanga had given the hosts a lot of hope but with the departure of Tharanga the Indian bowlers got back in charge of the proceedings. Sri Lanka, who were playing in this match without their regular captain Dinesh Chandimal, suspended on account of a slow over-rate offence against Bangladesh in Match 3, had Dasun Shanaka’s 19 off 16 balls plenty to thank for taking them past the 150-run mark. Washington Sundar was the second best Indian bowler on the evening as he returned 2/21 in his four overs. Jaydev Unadkat, Yuzvendra Chahal and Shankar took one wicket each. ', 'Indian Wells: World number one Roger Federer picked up where he left off, winning the four games he needed to defeat Federico Delbonis today after their match was interrupted the night before by rain. Federer returned to stadium court today afternoon and needed an hour to finish off his second round victory 6-3, 7-6 (8/6).His title defence got off to a soggy start yesterday night when play was suspended because of rain showers with Federer up a set and tied 2-2 in the second. The storm clouds rolled in just before the start of their match on Saturday and after a short delay to start the first set they managed to play until the heavy rains came in the second. After another 90-minute delay organizers suspended play for the night.Federer is making his 17th appearance in the California desert and is assured of remaining world number one if he makes it to the semi-finals in Indian Wells.He extended his 2018 win streak to 13 matches and has only dropped three sets from 34 played this year.Federer will face 25th-seed Filip Krajinovic in the third round.', 'New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the ‘Mary Kom Regional Boxing Foundation’ in Imphal on March 16 and present in the long-awaited event will be Olympic medallists — boxer Vijender Kumar and wrestler Sushil Kumar.Nestled at the foot of Langol hills in Manipur’s Imphal West district, Mary Kom’s Boxing Academy, spread across 3.3 acres, is around 10 km from the center of state capital Imphal. It currently houses 45 young boxers, including 20 girls, at the three-storey building.The land was allotted by the Manipur government in 2013, and the academy’s construction was funded by National Sports Development Fund (NSDF). “The foundation is grateful to both central and state government for the establishment of these sports facilities after many years of struggle since its inception in 2006,” it said in a press release.“The foundation expresses their gratitude to PMO for making (it) to the event and formally handover the buildings to the foundation for the promotion of boxing sports.”A five-time world and Asian champion, Mary Kom is also the country’s only woman boxer with an Olympic medal (a bronze won in London 2012 Games). The 35-year-old was christened ‘Magnificent Mary’ by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) a few years ago for her stellar career, which also includes an Asian Games gold medal.The most recent chapter of her extraordinary life journey was becoming a Rajya Sabha MP in 2016 and winning her fifth Asian Championships gold medal a year later.

The palatial flat is about 2675 sq ft for which the duo will be spending a whopping Rs 15 lakh as monthly rent. The buzz has it that the Indian cricket captain has paid Rs 1.50 crore as a deposit for the property and around Rs 1.01 for registration agreement.Worli is one of the most sought-after residential locations in Mumbai and the Indian skipper doesn’t want to move out of the area.Meanwhile, reports have it that Virat had purchased a plush flat in the same Worli area way back in 2016.

He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!” Rex Tillerson, a former chief executive of ExxonMobil, was only appointed to the post just over a year ago. Tillerson had just returned from a shortened trip to Africa hours before Trump’s announcement. Trump offered no explanation for the change.Donald Trump last Friday asked Tillerson to step aside, and the embattled top diplomat cut short his trip to Africa on Monday to return to Washington.Pompeo will replace him at the State Department, and Gina Hapsel – the deputy director at the CIA – will succeed him at the CIA, becoming the first woman to run the spy agency, if confirmed.The president – who has long clashed will Tillerson, who he believes is “too establishment” in his thinking – felt it was important to make the change now, as he prepares for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as upcoming trade negotiations, three White House officials said. ', 'London: British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday it was “highly likely” that Moscow was responsible for the poisoning in England of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter using a military-grade nerve agent.May told parliament that either the Russian state was directly responsible for the poisoning or it had allowed the nerve agent to get into the hands of others. London has given Russia until the end of Tuesday to explain its use. British officials had identified the substance as being part of the Novichok group of nerve agents that were developed by the Soviet military during the 1970s and 1980s, May said.Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, have been in hospital in critical condition since being found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre in the city of Salisbury on March 4.“Should there be no credible response, we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,” she said, calling the attack a “reckless and despicable act”.Russia’s foreign ministry hit back immediately, saying May’s comments were a “circus show” and part of a political information campaign against Russia.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States had “full confidence” in Britain’s assessment that Russia was likely responsible.“We agree that those responsible – both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it – must face appropriately serious consequences,” Tillerson said in a statement.Earlier, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the United States stood by America’s “closest ally,” but she stopped short of blaming Russia for the attack.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the use of any nerve agent was “horrendous and completely unacceptable” and “this incident is of great concern to NATO”.Relations between Britain and Russia have been strained since the murder in London of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.On Monday, May said the latest poisoning took place “against a backdrop of a well-established pattern of Russian state aggression” and that Britain was ready to take “much more extensive measures” against Russia than in the past.Russia’s ambassador to London has been summoned to explain to British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson how the nerve agent came to have been used.“On Wednesday we will consider in detail the response from the Russian state,” May said.Novichok agents are believed to be five to 10 times more lethal than the more commonly known VX and Sarin gases. They cause a slowing of the heart and restriction of the airways, leading to death by asphyxiation, University of Reading pharmacology professor Gary Stephens said.Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off a question about the affair while visiting a grain centre in southern Russia, saying British authorities should first “get to the bottom of things”, the BBC’s Moscow correspondent wrote on Twitter.Russian state TV accused Britain of poisoning Skripal as part of a special operation designed to spoil Russia’s hosting of soccer’s World Cup this summer.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Skripal worked for British intelligence and the attack happened in Britain so it was not a matter for the Russian government.A British policeman who was one of the first to attend to the stricken spy was also affected by the nerve agent. He is now conscious in serious but stable condition, police said.Skripal is a former colonel in Russia’s GRU military intelligence who was convicted of passing secrets to Britain’s MI6 intelligence agency and later exchanged in a spy swap.The chairman of the British parliament’s foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, said Russia’s so-called oligarchs, who have amassed fortunes during Putin’s 18-year rule, should be denied entry to the luxuries of London and the West.The British capital has been dubbed “Londongrad” due to the large quantities of Russian money that have poured in since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.May said last year that Putin was seeking to undermine the West and the international order by meddling in elections, and promised to ensure corrupt money did not flow into Britain from Russia.A British public inquiry found the 2006 killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoy – a former KGB bodyguard who later became a member of the Russian parliament.Cordons remained in place in the centre of Salisbury and some police investigators wore full chemical and biological suits. The army was later deployed to help remove items from the scene.Health officials said there was no wider risk to public health.Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, suggested members of the public who had visited the same restaurant and pub as Skripal and his daughter on March 4 should wash their clothes, clean phones and bags with baby wipes and wash items such as jewellery and spectacles with warm water and detergent.', 'Bengaluru: India’s third largest private sector bank Axis Bank has said it would soon be able to process payments over the popular chatting application ‘WhatsApp’.When the practical application of this service kicks off, the bank will become one of the first in the country to begin full processing of payments through UPI-based Whatsapp Payments.

', 'New Delhi: French president Emmanuel Macron, who was on India visit, is learnt to have told Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and former prime minister Manmohan Singh that France does not have any objection to Indian government revealing the pricing details of the Rafale fighter jets bought by New Delhi in 2016.Quoting sources, a report in NDTV said, Macron raised the issue during his meeting with Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh on Sunday.Congress has been campaigning against the BJP-led NDA government over the Rs 58,000 crore deal to buy 36 fighter jets made by the French company Dassault Aviation. Congress chief has attacked the government for not making public the prices of Rafale fighter aircraft, and charged that there was a “scam” in the deal.The Congress claims that the price of the fighter jets was higher than what was finalised by the United Progressive Alliance government which had negotiated a deal for 126 aircrafts.According to sources, Macron gave a positive response to Rahul Gandhi and said that France had no issues with the details of pricing being disclosed in the interest of transparency and accountability. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in a response to a written question Rajya Sabha last month, had refused to share the details of the deal on the grounds of security agreement signed between India and France. Congress sources further alleged that the government is using the 2008 security pact for non-disclosure as a fig leaf as the French President has unequivocally asserted that government did not have any issues with the disclosing of the pricing details. India and France inked the inter-government pact for buying 36 Rafale fighters, off the shelf, on September 23, 2016, after long negotiations, agreed upon during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to France in April 2015.', 'Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat on Tuesday acknowledged the military might of China, saying “Chinese have finally arrived”. During a media interaction, the Army chief pointed that China ensured rise of its military power along with its economic prowess.“Chinese have finally arrived. I can say that. They did not forget that military power should rise simultaneously with economy,” said General Rawat. He further acknowledged that China stands “strong today in the world order, challenging the might of the US”.According to the Army chief, counties across the world have started looking up to India after the rise of China. He said, “As China has risen, countries have started looking up to India to see whether we can also become a nation that can balance the rise of China.”It was because of China’s assertiveness that the focus of the international community shifted towards the Indo-Pacific region, said General Rawat.This comes days after the Army chief blamed Pakistan and China for influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. He had said that it is part of a proxy warfare by Pakistan, which is getting support from China with an aim to keep the area disturbed.“I think the proxy game is very well played by our western neighbour, supported by our northern border (China) to keep the area disturbed. We will continue to see some migration happening. The solution lies in identifying the problem and holistically looking at it,” he had said.India and China recently ended about a 70-day long military standoff at the Doklam tri-junction near the Sikkim border which had strained bilateral ties.In another reference to China, Rawat had said in August 2017 that China was attempting to ‘change the status quo’ on its border with India and incidents like stand-off in the Doklam area were likely to ‘increase’ in future.“The recent stand-off in the Doklam plateau by the Chinese side attempting to change the status quo are issues which we need to be wary about, and I think such kind of incidents are likely to increase in the future,” he had said.', 'A racist, hate-filled letter that calls on people to attack Muslims has gone viral in the UK. The letter has been posted to many people anonymously and declares April 3 as ‘Punish a Muslim Day’, and offers ‘rewards’ for different types of attacks on Muslims. An investigation has been launched into the letter.The letter claims to be from Her Majesty’s Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS), a part of UK’s Ministry of Justice (MoJ) that is responsible for the administration of criminal, civil and family courts and tribunals in England and Wales. However, both HMCTS and MoJ have denied any association with the letter.“They have hurt you, they have made your loved ones suffer. They have caused you pain and heartache. What are you going to do about it? Are you a ‘sheep’ like the vast majority of the population?” reads the letter, pictures of which have been posted to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.“Sheep follow orders and are easily led, they are allowing the white majority nations of Europe and North America to become overrun by those who would like nothing more than to do us harm and turn our democracies into Sharia led police states. Only you can help turn this thing around, only you have the power. Do not be a sheep!” the letter continues.“Punish A Muslim Day” letters are being sent to families in East London. The letter details a point system for each action & a reward. For example pulling a Muslim women’s hijab is 25 points, throwing acid is 50 points and burning or bombing a mosque is a whole 1,000 points. pic.twitter.com/6kmCrDrXt0— Rowaida Abdelaziz (@Rowaida_Abdel) March 9, 2018The letter then goes on to detail a point system to reward ‘action taken’. For instance, it offers 10 points for verbally abusing a Muslim and 25 points for pulling the hijab of a Muslim woman. The list goes on, with the rewards increasing along with the barbarity of the task and how regressive it is. It offers 1000 points for burning or bombing a mosque and the highest level being 2500 points to ‘nuke Mecca’.HMCTS and MoJ have both denied having anything to do with the letter.“We’re aware of a deeply offensive letter circulating that misuses our contact details.

Former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who recently quit the JDU-BJP alliance in Bihar, also was part of the dinner. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh was also part of the dinner.Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav, BSP’s Satish Mishra, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha’s Babulal Marandi, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh, AIUDF’s Badruddin Ajmal and Communist Party of India’s D Raja were also among those who attended the dinner hosted at 10, Janpath.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Dinner hosted by Sonia ji for Opposition parties should not be seen from the prism of politics, it was for friendship and better dialogue between parties.”Sonia had invited DMK working president MK Stalin for dinner, but he had earlier responded that he would not be able to attend as the Assembly session in Tamil Nadu was beginning from March 15.Sonia had recently called for Opposition unity saying parties should set aside their minor differences to get together in the larger interest of keeping the BJP out of power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “It is difficult for all the parties, including the Congress, because while we can get together at the national level, on some issues we are opponents at the ground level. So, there is a lot of pressure from all the parties, from my party, from the party of another leader. For instance, in West Bengal and many other states, it is a difficult task,” she had on March 9, 2018, said at an event in the national capital.', 'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that the linking of Aadhaar cards with bank accounts and mobile phones will not be mandatory until the apex court delivers the final judgment.The five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, said that the government cannot insist for mandatory Aadhaar.The top court has been hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the Unique Identification number. The order indefinitely extends the deadline of March 31 to link the 12-digit Unique Identification number.Aadhaar will, however, be required for social schemes, the SC said.On December 15, 2017, the apex court had extended till March 31, 2018, the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar with various services and welfare schemes.Earlier senior advocate Shyam Divan, who had led the arguments challenging Aadhaar and its enabling Act, said that the deadline of March 31 be extended as it was highly unlikely that the hearing in the case challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act will be concluded.“The deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar with various services and welfare schemes is March 31. This will have all India ramification as various institution would have to adjust themselves accordingly,” Divan had said.Justice Chandrachud said even if the court reserved its verdict on March 20, 2018, the banks and other institution would have only 10 days left, which might be difficult.The bench then called the Attorney General for assistance in the issue.At the fag end of the day’s hearing, Venugopal appeared before the bench and made the statement about the possibility of extension of the deadline.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, who argued against the Aadhaar scheme, said it violated the fundamental rights of citizens.In February this year, former Karnataka High Court judge Justice KS Puttaswamy had told the apex court that several deaths had reportedly taken place due to starvation on account of glitches in the Aadhaar-based public distribution system and the court must consider granting them compensation.He had urged the bench to consider granting compensation to those who had suffered on the ground of exclusion due to Aadhaar, particularly the kin of the starvation death victims.The top court had also observed that the alleged defect of citizens’ biometric details under the Aadhaar scheme being collected without any law could be cured by subsequently bringing a statute.It had said that the Centre came out with the law in 2016 to negate the objection that it was collecting data since 2009 without any authorisation, but the issue which needed consideration was what would happen if the data collected earlier, had been compromised.

The Chennai side had won the title in 2015.Local lad Dhanapal Ganesh found the back of the net with a superb header in the 29th minute to put the team 2-0 ahead at the Nehru Stadium.Chennaiyin now face Bengaluru FC at the grande finale on March 17 at Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bangalore.Bengaluru FC had beaten FC Pune City on 3-1 aggregate in the other double leg semifinals.FC Goa, with their backs to the wall after falling behind by two goals in the first half, tried hard but the home team’s defence was equal to the task. The league’s top-scorer Ferran Corominas and the speedy Hugo Boumous were kept in check as the CFC defence showed its versatility.Goalie Karanjit Singh has been a key member of the CFC side all season and he showed his utility with some superb saves. His effort to deny Lanzarote in the 86th minute was among them as he moved quickly to his right to palm away a superb freekick.He had also done very well to keep out a piledriver from Ahmed Jahouh in the 76th minute as the Goa players pushed ahead in search of goals.The first half saw the visiting side enjoying a lion’s share of the possession (61 per cent to CFC’s 39) but that mattered little as the hosts had scored twice.Like in the first leg, FC Goa had more possession but the Chennaiyin looked to mount attacks whenever they had the chance.CFC’s defence has been good right through the tournament and rose to the occasion yet again. On a night when the Goa forwards threw everything at the opposition, the Chennaiyin back line kept things under control.It was an entertaining first half which saw Chennaiyin FC nose ahead in some style. Though FC Goa blazed away and created a lot of trouble for the Chennaiyin back line, some lazy defending let them down.The opening goal came against the run of play. Jeje, who had missed a clear chance just a few minutes ago, found the goal in the 26th minute.Gregory Nelson put in a brilliant ball from the left and found Jeje, who was unmarked. This time he made no mistake and beat the keeper Naveen Kumar, who was preferred over Laxmikant Kattimani.Three minutes later, Chennaiyin took control of the match as Dhanapal Ganesh found himself on the scoresheeet.The goal came about after another defensive lapse by FC Goa. Nelson put in another superb ball via a free kick from the left. It was aimed at the far post where Ganesh rose majestically and headed it in.After a slow start, CFC began to gain more of the ball and had their first real chance when Francisco’s attempted cross hit Narayan Das’ arm in the 21st minute. Nelson’s subsequent free kick found Jeje unmarked inside the area but the forward could not time his leap well and sent the header over the bar.The first leg had ended in a 1-1 draw at Fatorda.', 'India’s shooting team that that topped the medals tally in Guadalajara, Mexico has drawn big praise from none other other than Sachin Tendulkar.

His brilliant show during the New Zealand tour saw him get his rightful place back.He will be backed by the 22-year-old talent Suraj Karkera who played a crucial part in the team’s good show in Bhubaneswar last year in his senior counterpart’s absence. Sardar’s exclusion was on expected lines as he performed below-par at this year’s Azlan Shah tournament. However a few eyebrows were raised with Ramandeep Singh being dropped despite his decent show in the same tournament.Youngsters Dilpreet Singh and Vivek Sagar Prasad, who made their international debut during the New Zealand tour have been rewarded with this opportunity for their good show. Both the players scored in important games.Freeman and drag-flick expert Rupinder Pal Singh will form India’s wall of defence along with Harmanpreet Singh, Varun Kumar, Kothajit Singh, Gurinder Singh and Amit Rohidas. India’s midfield will see skipper Manpreet Singh in the lead role, ably supported by the experience of Chinglensana along with young blood in Sumit and Vivek.The Indian attack will feature a lethal combination between experience and youth as SV Sunil, Akashdeep Singh, Mandeep Singh, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay, Gurjant Singh and Dilpreet Singh are all in the team. “This squad has been picked keeping in mind the performance in the previous tournaments since the Asia Cup 2017. We have tried out different combinations in the past events and we believe this will be the most effective combination for the Gold Coast 2018 XXI Commonwealth Games,” said chief coach Sjoerd Marijne.He further stated that the team has a winning mindset and will look to aim for the best in the quadrennial event. “This team has been improving with every match and while we could not produce a podium finish at the 27th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup 2018, it will have no influence on how we are going to play in Australia and we will be going there with a mindset to win,” said the 43-year-old Dutch Coach.In the previous two outings at the Commonwealth Games, India has finished second behind Australia. Skipper Manpreet Singh, however, is confident of turning the tables this time. “Our first aim is to do well in the group stage because we have some strong teams in our Pool. It’s extremely crucial to top our table and make the semi-final but if we do meet Australia in the knockouts, I believe we will be up for a strong challenge,” said the 25-year-old Manpreet.Squad: Goalkeepers: PR Sreejesh, Suraj Karkera;\\nDefenders: Rupinder Pal Singh, Harmanpreet Singh, Varun Kumar, Kothajit Singh, Gurinder Singh, Amit Rohidas;\\nMidfielders: Manpreet Singh (C), Chinglensana Singh (vice-captain), Sumit, Vivek Sagar Prasad; Forwards: Akashdeep Singh, SV Sunil, Gurjant Singh, Mandeep Singh, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay, Dilpreet Singh.\\nCoach: Sjoerd Marijne.', 'The Briton was known for his groundbreaking work with black holes and relativity, and was the author of several popular science books including A Brief History of Time.His children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said: “We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today.“He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years.”They praised his “courage and persistence” and said his “brilliance and humour” inspired people across the world.“He once said, ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ We will miss him forever,” they said.', 'Beijing: China appears to be “winning” its war on air pollution, making so much progress that life expectancy could rise by more than two years, according to a US university study. The Chinese government has been waging a battle to clear its skies of smog that has cut life expectancy in some regions and prompted its citizens to buy masks and air purifiers to protect themselves during peak pollution days.The University of Chicago says in its study released on Monday that while the world’s biggest polluter faces a long road to reach national and international air quality standards, the results “suggest the country is winning its war on pollution”. Based on daily data from more than 200 monitors across China from 2013 to 2017, the analysis found that cities have cut levels of PM 2.5 — the tiny airborne particles considered most harmful to health — by an average of 32 per cent in just four years. If sustained, such reductions would increase the life expectancy of the average Chinese citizen by 2.4 years relative to 2013. PM 2.5 can play a role in heart disease, stroke, and lung ailments such as emphysema and cancer. Another study published by the university last year had found that air pollution in northern China had cut life expectancy by three years compared with the south of the country.“We don’t have a historical example of a country achieving such rapid reductions in air pollution. It’s remarkable,” Michael Greenstone the economist and director of the Energy Policy Instit-ute at the University of Chicago who conducted the studies, said. By contrast, it took the US a dozen years and a severe recession to attain similar improvements in air quality after it enacted its 1970 Clean Air Act, he noted. “What these last four years have demonstrated quite loudly is that things can change and they can change rapidly — it just requires political will,” he said.', 'New York: At least one California high school student was injured superficially when a teacher accidentally discharged a gun in class during a firearms safety course, police said on Wednesday.The incident, which occurred Tuesday, came as a police officer assigned to a school in the state of Virginia accidentally fired his service weapon inside his office and was placed on administrative leave.The massacre of 17 students and staff in Parkland, Florida, last month has ignited a nationwide debate over whether some teachers should be armed, with President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in favor.Dennis Alexander, a teacher at Seaside High School in California`s Monterey County and a reserve police officer, fired a semiautomatic handgun as it was pointed at the ceiling, police chief Abdul Pridgen said in a statement.Pridgen said no one was hit by gunfire or seriously hurt and police registered one injury in the incident, although local media reported that three teenagers were struck by falling masonry.“One student had an abrasion to his neck, a red mark. When the bullet stroked the ceiling some debris came down. We didn`t confirm two others,” Seaside police commander Judy Veloz told AFP. “There was no panic in the school. The teacher has been put on administrative leave. We`re still investigating, interviewing students. The school is open as usual.”Fermin Gonzales, the father of the 17-year-old boy to whom police were referring, told NBC affiliate KSBW Alexander had informed the class he was going to demonstrate how to disarm someone and was checking if the weapon was loaded.“It`s the craziest thing,” said Gonzales, who added that bruising to his son`s neck appeared to have been caused by a bullet fragment.A spokeswoman for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District said in a statement education officials and police began interviewing students immediately after the alarm was raised.“It was determined that there was no immediate threat to students or staff, and school remained in session,” she said.She added that the district allows only authorized law enforcement or security personnel to possess weapons on school property or transport. Students would be offered counsleling, she said.Alexander, who also teaches math, has been placed on leave both as a teacher and in his position as a reserve officer for the Sand City Police Department. He could not immediately be reached for comment.The Alexandria Police Department in Virginia meanwhile said it was investigating after an officer accidentally discharging his weapon at George Washington Middle School on Tuesday morning.“At approximately 9:10 a.m., a School Resource Officer accidentally discharged his service weapon inside his office at the middle school,” the police said in a statement.“He immediately checked for potential injuries in the area. No one was injured. The officer then contacted his supervisor and school staff. All students and staff are safe and classes continued as normal.”The officer was placed on administrative leave pending the probe.Students across the United States walked out of classes on Wednesday in a nationwide call for action against gun violence, many gathering outside the White House and chanting “Never again!” and “Enough is enough!”Concealed carry at colleges and schools has been banned since 2015 in California and police are understood to be establishing whether Alexander violated any regulations by bringing a gun onto campus.“I think a lot of questions on parents` minds are, why a teacher would be pointing a loaded firearm at the ceiling in front of students,” Superintendent PK Diffenbaugh told CNN affiliate KSBW.“Clearly in this incident protocols were not followed.”', 'Geneva: The members of the Baloch Republican Party (BPR) have raised the issue of human rights violations carried out by Pakistan in Balochistan at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).“The precious natural resources of Balochistan are being looted and taken away by the Pakistani state while the Baloch people are forced to live in Stone Age-like conditions,” said representative of the Baloch Republican Party to the UNHRC Abdul Nawaz Bugti.“Whenever the Baloch people demanded their rights from the Pakistani state, the response has always been military operations and massacre by the army,” he added, “300 thousand Baloch have been displaced and 27 thousands more have become the victim of enforced disappearances.”He noted that “torture and custodial killings of Baloch activists are common practice. Even women and children are not spared.”Another activist of BPR threw light on the plight of women in Balochistan.“While the world talks about gender equality and equal rights for women, the women in Balochistan are facing state terrorism, in addition to global problems,” activist, BPR Muhammad Jawad.“They are most affected by the military operations, enforced disappearances of their family members,” he added.Jawad went on to say that “there is hardly women in Balochistan who has not lost his husband, brother, father or son as a result of notorious kill and dump policy of Pakistan Army.”(ANI)', 'Washington DC: Thousands of students across the United States (US) walked out of their schools on Wednesday to call for action against gun violence precisely one month post the Florida shooting which claimed 17 lives.Students from more than 3,000 schools took to the streets from Washington to Los Angeles and from New York to Parkland, reported the Independent.Organized by Empower, the youth arm of the Women’s March movement, the walkouts are the latest show of activism by young people who are now wading into the gun-control debate.Student speakers boomed outrage and grief for a problem that has a growing body count – both in and out of schools.According to the reports, students clutched signs that read “I should be writing my college essay, not my will.” Others read “Enough is enough.”Celebrities on Twitter expressed their support for the demonstrations, including Chris Evans, Miley Cyrus, Zendaya, and Kerry Washington.Some students went to the White House and sat on the closed-off portion of Pennsylvania Avenue for a 17-minute moment of silence. They sat on the street with their backs to the executive mansion. ', 'Yet another woman falls prey to the jilted lover’s wrath. 29-year-old Anna Ergieva’s horrified parents had the misfortune of discovering her headless body lying in a pool of blood when she failed to answer her phone.The Ukranian woman had been chatting with an ex-boyfriend who was also a former classmate, the DailyMail reported. Ergieva’s ex-boyfriend who had decided to pay her a visit made sexual advances and upon being refused flew into a jealous rage and shot her in the head.Her severed head was later discovered buried, “stuffed in a bag with some of her jewellery.”Police arrested the unnamed man in relation to Ergieva’s brutal murder, who after initially attacking officers and attempting to slash his own wrist gave in and confessed to the murder.The 29-year-old said he had decapitated Ergieva’s body so as to abstain investigators from discovering the bullet lodged in her skull.“An alarm button was found lying beside the corpse…It seems the victim made an attempt to call for help, but was murdered before pushing the button,” a police spokesman said.Ergieva’s life came to an abrupt and gruesome end only because she refused to have sex with an ex-partner, who now faces life imprisonment.', 'New Delhi: A Parliamentary Standing Committee has recommended five years of compulsory military service for anyone who wants a subsequent employment with the state or the central government.According to reports, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) – a wing of government that reports to the Prime Minister – is believed to have prepared a proposal in this regard.The DoPT believe that five years of compulsory military service for those seeking government job will also make up for the shortage of personnel in the armed forces.The DopT is tasked with administering and making policy for all government servants. The proposal comes at a time when the Indian Army alone is short of over 7,000 officers and over 20,000 men. Likewise, the Indian Air Force has a shortage of nearly 150 officers and over 15,000 men and the Indian Navy faces a shortage of 150 officers and nearly 15,000 men.The Central government alone has about 30 lakh employees with the Indian Railways, while the state governments employ about another two crore people.The Parliament Standing Committee had made this recommendation with the understanding that the perennial and alarming situation of shortage of Officers and PBOR in Armed Forces would stand corrected. This way, the Central and State Government Services will also get enriched by the disciplined officers/PBOR. The Committee are perturbed to note the lukewarm response of the Ministry to this important recommendation with the onus now being shifted to DOP&T.The Committee desire that issue of shortage of officers should be given priority as it is directly related to national security. The Ministry of Defence should take up this matter at the higher levels in the Department of Personnel and Training and should try to convince them with their demand. The Committee desire that Ministry of Defence should inform them about the outcome of such discussion.', 'New Delhi: The World Bank on Wednesday said that Indian economy is “credible” and expected to grow at 7.3 percent in FY 2018-19 and 7.5 percent in FY 2019-20 driven by private consumption, investment, and exports.For the current financial year ending on March 31, the Washington-based multi-lateral funding agency has projected the economy to grow at 6.7 percent.India’s growth has been credible over the long run with growth averaging at 7 percent in the last decade, it said. “India’s GDP growth saw a temporary dip in the last two quarters of 2016-17 and the first quarter of 2017-18 due to demonetisation and disruptions surrounding the initial implementation of GST (Goods and Services Tax),” World Bank said in its India Development Update.“The GDP growth is projected to reach 6.7 percent in 2017-18 and accelerate to 7.3 percent and 7.5 percent in 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively,” it said.Services will continue to remain the main driver of economic growth, it said. Industrial activity is also poised to grow, with manufacturing expected to accelerate following the implementation of GST, it said, adding that agriculture is likely growing at its long-term average growth rate.“Steadily and slowly, India has been growing. It’s a steady growth, volatility has decreased, the growth is driven by one factor unlike China by exports. India’s growth is far more diversified through investment, private consumption and exports,” said Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India while talking to reporters here.The report observed however that a growth of over 8 percent will require “continued reform and a widening of their scope” aimed at resolving issues related to credit and investment, and enhancing competitiveness of exports.“The Indian economy is likely to recover from the impact of demonetisation and the GST, and growth should revert slowly to a level consistent with its proximate factors — that is, to about 7.5 percent a year,” the report said.In November 2016, the Modi government had scrapped high value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 in a bid to check black money, among others.Later, India implemented its biggest indirect tax reform — Goods and Services Tax (GST). Both of these initiatives had impacted the economic activities in the country in short run.India’s economic growth had slipped to a three year low of 5.7 percent in April-June quarter of the current financial year, though it recovered in the subsequent quarters.The economy is expected to grow at 6.6 percent in the current fiscal ending March 31, as per the second advanced estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO), compared to 7.1 percent in 2016-17. The earlier estimate was 6.5 percent.The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament has projected a growth rate of 7 to 7.5 percent in the 2018-19 financial year.The World Bank report further said that accelerating the growth rate will also require continued integration into global economy.It pitches for making growth more inclusive and enhancing the effectiveness of the Indian public sector.Growth at higher levels would require support from global economy and reversal in the declining trends in investment, credit and exports, said the World Bank update.Maintaining the hard-won macroeconomic stability, a definitive and durable solution to the banking sector issues, realisation of the expected growth and fiscal dividend from the GST and regaining the momentum on an unfinished structural reform agenda are key components of this, it said.“India’s long-term growth has become more steady, stable, diversified and resilient.“In the long-run, for higher growth to be sustainable and inclusive, India needs to use land and water, which are increasingly becoming scarce resources, more productivity, make growth more inclusive, and strengthen its public sector to meet the challenges of a fast-growing, globalising and increasingly middle-class economy,” Ahmad said.The World Bank country framework partnership “sets the tone of our investment commitment for coming five years. Today we are putting in approximately $3.5 billion per year in various projects (in India). We expect to go to $4-4.5 billion”, Ahmad added.Poonam Gupta, the Lead Economist and the main author of the report said that durable revival in private investments and exports would be crucial for India achieving a sustained high growth of 8 percent and over.“Resorting to countercyclical policies will not help spur sustained growth and India should not compromise its hard-earned fiscal discipline in order to accelerate growth,” she said.The World Bank update said it will be crucial for India to leverage on the global recovery to elevate its growth rate.On the flip side, it said oil prices pose less of a risk for the Indian economy, the expected normalisation of monetary policy by the US and the other advanced economies are likely to tighten financing conditions.(With PTI inputs)', 'Lucknow/Patna: In a massive blow the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Samajwadi Party on Wednesday wrested Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats from the ruling party in Uttar Pradesh. The defeat was even more shocking as the seats belonged to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. They had vacated them after the state Assembly elections in 2017.Gorakhpur can be said to be a bigger setback as the seat has been held by Yogi since 1991 for a record five times.  The BJP’s applecart was dislodged primarily by the arithmetic of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) backing its bitter rival the SP. SP’s Nagendra Singh Patel defeated BJP’s Kashlendra Singh Patel in Phulpur and in Gorakhpur Pravin Nishad of the SP crushed BJP candidate Upendra Dutt Shukla. Stunned by the defeat, Yogi said that the party’s performance in two Lok Sabha bypolls was a lesson for them. “When the candidates were declared, the SP, BSP and Congress were not together. They had not joined hands then. But suddenly in the middle of the election, the SP and the BSP forged an electoral understanding,” he told the media from his residence.“The over-confidence and inability to understand the electoral understanding between the SP and the BSP led to the defeat,” Yogi accepted. He also said that local issues led to BJP’s poor performance in bypolls, not policies of Centre.On his part, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav attributed his party’s win to the support from Dalits, farmers, labourers, women and unemployed. “It is the victory of social justice,” he said. In 2014, the BJP had stunningly won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats while one of its allies had secured two seats. The SP had won five seats and the Congress had won two seats. The BSP had drawn a blank.Meanwhile, not much can be read from the results from Bihar as both the BJP and the RJD retained their seats.The RJD held on to the Jehanabad Assembly seat and the BJP won the Bhabua constituency. In Araria Lok Sabha bypolls, the RJD again retained its seat.In Jehanabad, RJD’s Suday Yadav defeated his Janata Dal (United) rival Abhiram Sharma, while in Bhabua, BJP’s Rinki Rani Pandey defeated her Congress rival Shambhu Singh Patel. And in Araria, RJD’s Sarfaraz Alam defeated his nearest BJP adversary Pradip Kumar Singh.Suday Yadav is the son of former state minister Mundrika Singh Yadav, whose death necessitated the bypoll. Araria was represented by RJD Mohammad Taslimuddin whose death on September 17, 2017, necessitated the bypoll.The RJD candidate at Araria Sarfaraz Alam, who crossed over from JD(U) to Lalu Prasad’s party to enter into fray in the bypoll, is son of Taslimuddin. Lalu Prasad Yadav’s party contested Araria and Jehanabad seats and it gave Bhabua to ally Congress in a seat-sharing arrangement. However, defeat of JD(U) nominee Abhiram Sharma at Jehanabad could be bad news for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who had in July 2017 dumped the Grand Alliance and joined hands with the BJP to form a coalition government.', 'New Delhi: The post of Border Security Force (BSF) at Hindumalkot in Rajasthan is as hi-tech as it can get. The post is one of the most sensitive in the world and the BSF mans it round the clock. The dog squad team also contributes majorly to in keeping the border safe here. As per details accessed Zee Media, HHTI (hand-held thermal imager) technique is being used in the Hindumalkot border post. It works on the theory of heat detection system and helps the security personnel to see images almost akin to daytime. In the control room at the Indo-Pak border, the hi-tech gadgets help in the good visibility upto 3-4 kilometres after sunset. Any movement or person can be detected with the help of these gadgets. The BSF is also using other new ways for fool-proof security and Cobra wire is one of them. Cobra wire gives out high voltage current and it is used in between the fencing at the border.  This is said to be a major deterrent when it comes to infiltration bids by Pakistan. An intruder becomes unconscious when comes in contact with Cobra wire when trying to cut the fencing.  Searchlights and HHTI are used to keep an eye on any living beings in the vicinity. And the dog squad helps to keep keeping an eye on any movement near the border. The dogs in these squads are trained to specifically patrol at night. In August 2017, BSF chief DG KK Sharma had said that sealing the Indian border with Pakistan was an immediate ‘priority’ and a smart technology- aided fence would be in place along the Jammu sector by March 2018.', 'Officially revealed towards the end of last month, the all-new Audi A6 made its global debut at the 2018 Geneva motor show. A key model in Audi’s line-up, there’s plenty that has changed on the new A6. Here are the five most important things you need to know about it:It’s all-new\\nDon’t be deceived by the new A6’s appearance. While it may not be much of a departure from its predecessor design-wise, this really is an all-new car. The face is dominated by the Matrix LED headlamps, Audi’s trademark Singleframe grille and enlarged air intakes. Now in its eighth-generation, the A6 has also grown in size. It’s 7mm longer at 4,939mm, 12mm wider at 1,886mm, and 2mm taller at 1,457mm than the outgoing A6, and to that effect, also has more interior space. Audi claims there is more headroom, shoulder room and rear leg room than before. And though boot space stays the same at 530 litres, the carmaker says the boot has a wider aperture and can accommodate two golf bags horizontally. It’s loaded with tech\\nYou’d expect an Audi to be loaded with the latest in the world of in-car technology and the A6 promises to not disappoint on that front. The interior borrows heavily from the new A8’s, and Audi is positioning its infotainment system as a key selling point for the A6, describing it as a “futuristic operating concept.” There are two central touchscreens, both 8.6-inches as standard, with a 10.1-inch upper screen available as an option. The system, known as MMI, allows vehicle functions, shortcuts and favourite buttons to be dragged and dropped, akin to a smartphone. The new navigation includes a self-learning function based on driven routes, which generates intelligent search suggestions. For example, the system knows your daily route to work and will suggest another way if it knows there has been an accident. The navigation system also uses vehicle-to-vehicle technology with other Audis for traffic and hazard information.It has autonomous driving capabilities, but…\\nWith self-driving cars becoming all the rage globally, Audi has equipped the new A6 with autonomous driving functionality. Among the 37 driving assistance systems, there is the Level 3 autonomous driving system introduced on last year’s A8, but there’s a catch. Although the technology is available, the A6 faces the same issue as the A8: the legislation is not yet in place to allow the use of Level 3 autonomous systems on a public road unless it is for manufacturer testing. The likelihood of this feature making it to India isn’t high.It’ll have a set of mild-hybrid powertrains\\nGlobally, Audi will offer the new A6 with mild-hybrid engines only – much like the recently launched A7 – and is likely to later offer a plug-in hybrid as ‘bridge technology’ to pure electric. For now, the new A6 will be offered with four engine options that include a 3.0-litre V6 TFSI petrol and three diesels – a 2.0-litre TDI and a 3.0-litre TDI in two states of tune. The 3.0 TFSI and 2.0-litre TDI use a 48V electrical system, which has a lithium ion battery positioned in the rear axle and a starter/generator at the front of the car. This mild-hybrid system switches off the engine and cruises between speeds of 55kph and 160kph. When decelerating, it switches off the engine between 6kph and 22kph. The two 3.0-litre TDI powertrains use a 12V electrical system that does not offer these features.It’s coming to India\\nThe outgoing A6 has been left far behind by its rivals-in-chief, the Mercedes-Benz E-class and BMW 5-series, and so, Audi will bring in the new one early in 2019. While a diesel engine will be on offer, we expect the focus to be on the petrol-powered variants, in keeping with Audi’s new powertrain strategy.', 'KURNOOL: A father was sent on a 14-day jail term for the first time in Kurnool district for allowing his teenage son to drive a motor cycle registered in his name. Judicial Magistrate First Class (JFMC), Special Mobile Court, Mr M. Babu remanded Pothuraju Lakshmanna, 48, for a 14 day jail term. Pothuraju, a native of Penchikalapadu village in Gudur Mandal of Kurnool district, allowed his 19-year-old son Ella Ramudu to drive his two wheeler. The teenager was accused of hitting one Pakkira Dastagiri of Penchikalapadu village who was seriously injured and died.Accusing Ella Ramudu for negligent driving, police produced both the son and his father before the Special Mobile Court by the Kurnool Rural Circle Inspector Nagaraju who termed the case as “murder without murdering”. Kurnool Superindent of Police Gopinath Jatti said that the vicarious liability for the wrongs done by the teenage children would fall on their parents and cautioned parents not to allow their children to drive without any valid papers like licence. He said that in accidents wherein minors are involved, parents will be held responsible and their role will be examined during the court hearing, adding that police would argue for a stringent approach towards minors driving vehicles and to get the parents punished first. “Underage driving is a cause of concern these days, especially when police is not ready to tolerate even simple acts of negligence in following traffic rules,” the SP added.', 'Thiruvananthapuram: The anti-piracy cell of the state police has made a breakthrough cracking a gang pirating new South Indian movies and uploading them on notorious film piracy sites like Tamilrockers.The police held five youngsters hailing from Tamil Nadu for piracy based on some ads appeared on these sites. They were found to have earned over Rs 1 crore through piracy over the last few years. They used to upload new movies on 19 domains including, tamilrockers.in, tamilrockers.ac, tamilrockers.me, tamilrockers.co, tamilrockers.is, tamilrockers.us and tamilrockers.ro. Pranav Mohanlal’s Aadhi was among their latest victims.Those arrested were Villupuram native Karthi, 24, his accomplice Suresh, 24, TNRockers owner Prabhu, 24, DVD Rockers owner Tirunelveli native Johnson and his accomplice Maria John, 22. Karthi and his accomplice made Rs 1 crore from hits, while others received up to Rs 75 lakh. The average monthly income of a gang member was found to be in the range of Rs 1 to 2 lakh, police sources said.Anti-piracy cell SP B. K. Prasanthan Kani, who headed the team that cracked the gang, said that a lead about them came from a Haryana based advertising firm that used to canvas ads for popular websites. The firm had sent an email with an offer to a person who was earlier held by the anti-piracy cell for pirating a Malayalam film. It led the police to the racket.“All the gang members were technically qualified. It even included MSc and BSc holders in computer science. They used to record movies in pieces from various parts of the world and join it. We are trying to trace more members of the gang including Karthi’s brothers,” said Mr Prasanathan.TN Rockers was found to be working from Villupuram and DVD Rockers from Tirunelveli. Laptops, hard disks and other gadgets used for piracy were recovered from them. They were brought to Thiruvananthapuram and produced before a local court here and remanded to judicial custody.', 'Bengaluru: In swift action, the Chamarajpet police cracked the murder of a 55-year-old home-alone woman and arrested two people, including the woman’s adopted daughter, within 24 hours of the crime committed.The deceased, Vijayamma, from Mangaluru, was hacked to death allegedly by her adopted daughter Sonu Pujari alias Gagan Pal (29) and her paramour Kumar (20) at her residence on Tin 5th Main, Chamarajpet on Tuesday. Vijayamma, who was single, owned a beauty parlour near Uma theatre, Chamarajpet. Sonu and Kumar, both residents of Dattatreya Block, K.G. Nagar, had hatched a plan to rob money and jewellery from Vijayamma as they were in financial crisis. While Sonu worked as an assistant in a beauty parlour at KG Nagar and lived in a paying guest accommodation, Kumar worked as an assistant in the same PG where Sonu lived.Around 1 pm on Tuesday, Sonu, as usual, visited Vijayamma and prepared food for her. A few minutes later, Kumar too arrived with liquor. The trio drank together and had food. Vijayamma, who was unaware of the duo’s plan, went to the kitchen, while Kumar followed her and strangled her with a cloth. When Vijayamma resisted, Sonu hit her in the head with a wooden log and she collapsed, the police said. The duo then ransacked the house and fled with the money and jewellery kept in a cupboard and on Vijayamma’s person.Vijaya’s friend Rajlakshmi visited the house around 7 pm and found the doors open. When she went inside, she found Vijaya in the kitchen, lying in a pool of blood. “Rajlakshmi ran out of the house and informed P.M. Lakshmi Narayan Gupta, who stays downstairs. She later filed a complaint with us,” the police said.\\nChamrajpet police, who registered the case, initially suspected the involvement of Sonu. When they detained her and questioned her, she confessed to the murder, saying her paramour Kumar too was involved, the police said. ', 'An electric McLaren was to be one of 15 new models in the firm’s Track 22 plan of new launches by 2022. However, this won’t be the case, company boss Mike Flewitt confirmed to our sister publication Autocar UK.“With EVs, developing is the right word, and we have an electric mule running around,” said Flewitt. “It’s more for the attributes than the powertrain itself. How exciting can an EV be? Next to the Senna, it isn’t.“We couldn’t deliver an EV today that would meet the excitement of the McLaren brand. We’re working on it. As the technology is developed, the performance capacity will come. It’s a good five years away. It’s a challenge to us to produce the same engagement as with the P1, Senna and 675LT. It’s some way off, and it’s not in the plan because we don’t have the answer at the moment.”Flewitt revealed that, currently for an EV to have the same performance as the P1, it would have to weigh two tonnes.He was more positive on hybrid development, though, and repeated his claim that 50 percent of McLarens would be hybrids by 2022 and, “to play it safe”, that all would be in 10 years’ time. “It’s on track,” he said.Hybrids are much easier to integrate into the design of a car’s powertrain, he added, allowing them to become an integral part of the engine and powertrain rather than bolt-on devices, as they were previously.“The downsides are weight and cost, but the upsides are reduced emissions and the ability to access zero-emission zones in cities,” said Flewitt. “It’s a better driving experience with a hybrid. We can do it with a hybrid but not with an EV.”', 'New Delhi: Your hair are probably the most precious part of your body and something that you consciously take care of every step of the way. But, the moment one begins to notice even the slightest increase in hair fall, their first instinct is to rush out and buy the latest anti-hair fall products, without first trying to find out the reason.It is said that losing 100 strands of hair per day is normal. But if you feel you’re losing more hair than the normal amount, it doesn’t necessarily have to be because of a disease. It could easily be due to hormonal changes, chemical imbalance, a lifestyle problem, et al.Each hair on our body has its own cycle, independent of the others. When this cycle is disrupted, be it because of medical conditions or poor nutrition, hair fall occurs.“Most cases of increased hair shedding gradually resolve on their own without treatment. But, if your hair doesn’t return to its normal fullness after 6 to 9 months, then you may require hair treatments,” said Prerna Taneja, Medical Director Clinic Eximus.So, before jumping to conclusions, check out the following reasons which can be responsible for your hair fall problems.Emotional or physical stress:\\nWhen you’re going through a stressful phase, you may experience hair loss as your body puts its resources towards getting you through that sad event. Also, overexerting yourself physically can also result in losing strands.Pollution:\\nSudden hair loss is imminent if the contaminants of air, including particulate matter, dust, smoke, nickel, lead and arsenic, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons settle on your scalp and hair.Poor diet:\\nIn order to be in their best shape, women these days indulge into dieting, which on the flip side can lead to lack of nutrition in their body, resulting in massive hair loss.Lack of sleep:\\nNot having enough sleep can also cause and thin down your tuft.Lack of protein:\\nIntake of nutrients, like protein, is essential as it helps make new hair cells. But, if your body doesn’t have enough of it, it won’t be able to replace your old hairs with the new ones.Changes in birth control pill:\\nGoing off the pill or changing to a different type of hormonal contraception is also one of the causes of hair loss in women.Pregnancy:\\nOwing to the estrogen hormones, women during pregnancy notice their hair going into rapid growth mode. But, once estrogen levels go back to normal after delivery, hair starts shredding again.Continuous styling or tight hairstyles:\\nRigorous styling and hair treatments over the years can thin the bunch on your head. Constant application of chemicals on hair weaken their roots. Wearing too tight ponytails is also one of the causes of hair loss among women.Anemia:\\nAlmost two in 10 women between 20 and 50 years of age suffer from iron deficiency, which is an easily fixable cause of hair loss.Hormonal changes:\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symbolizes imbalance in female sex hormones. An excess of androgens results in ovarian cysts, a higher risk of diabetes, changes in menstrual period, which ultimately affects the hair growth. Hypothyroidism is another big reason for hair loss.Heredity:\\nIf your family trend has always been in a way where women suffer from hair loss at a certain age, then you might be more prone to the same.Treatments for hair loss:\\nMesotherapy:\\nIt involves imparting a combination of various nutrients and medication that boosts hair growth naturally.Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP):\\nIn this treatment, the patient’s blood is drawn and is then processed. The platelet-rich blood is inserted via an injection into the problem areas of skin to organically support hair growth.Hair transplant:\\nThis treatment restores hair by transplanting new follicles into balding or thinning areas. Healthy follicles are taken from other areas of the body; mostly the back or the sides of the head.', 'India booked their place in the Nidahas T20 tri-series final by beating Bangladesh by 17 runs in Colombo on Wednesday. Captain Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina and Washington Sundar were the architects of the win that saw the Indian team, defending 176/3, restrict the Tigers to 159/6 for a third win in four matches.  Bangladesh’s Musfiqur Rahim (72* off 55 balls) kept his team in the hunt but the Indian total proved too big on a terribly low and slow pitch at the R Premadasa Stadium, and they fell fairly short of the target. The Tigers now will have to beat Sri Lanka handsomely on Friday to make another date with their powerful neighbours in the final on Sunday.  Sundar turned out to be a thorn in Bangladesh’s flesh, and do what they would, they found it difficult to deal with his offspinners and consequently he finished with an impressive 3/22. Shardul Thakur, Yuzvendra Chahal and Mohammed Siraj, who came in place of Jaydev Unadkat, took a wicket apiece.Earlier in the day after Mahmudullah put India into bat, openers Rohit and Shikar Dhawan found it tough to get going on a sluggish pitch.In light of the nature of the wicket, both batsmen dropped anchor a little and chose to play the ball on its merit. The result was a painstaking 70-run opening stand in 9.5 overs.Dhawan was not as fluent as he was in the previous matches and despite a Liton Das reprieve can’t go beyond 35 runs off 27 balls as Rubel Hossain bowled him with a brilliant yorker.Raina joined Rohit and he too struggled. Shortly after a new strategy was in place: both batsmen decided to go aerial in the hope they will execute their shots well. And boy did it work. India scored 105 runs in the last 10 overs with Rohit and Raina hitting six sixes together, with the former hitting four and the latter two. In all, Rohit hit five sixes.The 18th over bowled by Abu Hider Rony, who had replaced Taskin Ahmed in this match, yielded 21 runs thanks to three sixes, and with that the Indian innings got the boost it so desperately needed.After adding 102 runs off 56 balls for the second wicket, both Rohit (89 off 61 balls) and Raina (47 off 30 balls) departed in the last over but by that time they had done a terrific job on a difficult wicket, giving the Indian bowlers enough to defend.   The Bangladeshi cricket team may have lost the match but won many hearts with a moving gesture as their players sported black armbands to honour the memory of the 49 passengers who died in a plane crash at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan Airport in Nepal on Monday.', 'New Delhi: Ravichandran Ashwin says leadership tips from Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh will help him immensely in his maiden captaincy stint in the upcoming Indian Premier League.Ashwin will captain the Kings XI Punjab, who will also have the services of mentor Sehwag and senior player Yuvraj.“For me, it is all about incorporating whatever I have learnt over the years. I have played under a lot of captains including Viru paaji. My focus is on being strategically ahead of other captains,” said Ashwin on the sidelines of KXIP’s jersey launch here on Tuesday.“Both Yuvi and Viru paaji have been my captains at different stages of my career. I played under Yuvi paaji in my first Challenger Trophy and he has played a big role in whoever I am today. Learning from experiences and taking advice is something I am never averse to,” the off-spinner added.Ashwin has captained his state side Tamil Nadu in the past (leading them to Vijay Hazare triumph in 2009) but it will be the first time he will lead a side in the shortest format. He knows it’s a big responsibility.“You associate captaincy with pressure and power but for me leadership comes with a lot of responsibility. If you can use it as fulcrum that helps your team, I think we will be in good stead.”On paper, the current squad looks the strongest in KXIP’s history but they don’t have a specialist wicket-keeper after Wriddhiman Saha’s exit. Akshdeep Nath and Lokesh Rahul can be the two part-time options for the team.“Lots of teams have weaknesses and every team will try and overcome that. Most people see this (lack of specialist wicket-keeper) as a weakness for KXIP. On an average, in T20 games, every keeper gathers only six balls. So if our keeper can take those six balls, we will be fine,” he reasoned.Asked whether he sees IPL as a platform for a comeback in the India limited overs team, Ashwin’s reply was a curt “no.”', 'Birmingham: Star shuttlers PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth prevailed in tough first-round battles but Saina Nehwal exited from the prestigious All England Championship after suffering a straight-game defeat against World No. 1 and defending champion Tai Tzu-Ying here on Wednesday.World No 3 Srikanth recovered from a lop-sided opening game to struggle past France’s Brice Leverdez, ranked 23, 7-21 21-14 22-20, while Olympic and world championship silver medallist Sindhu staved off a stiff challenge from Thailand’s Pornpawee Chochuwong to prevail 20-22 21-17 21-9 in a 56-minute contest.Srikanth will square off against either China’s Huang Yuxiang or England’s Rajiv Ouseph, while Sindhu faces the winner of the match between USA’s Beiwen Zhang and Thailand’s Nitchaon Jindapol.Singapore Open champion B Sai Praneeth squandered an opening game advantage to go down 21-13 15-21 11-21 to fifth seed Korean Son Wan Ho.Srikanth was no match for Leverdez in the first game as he failed to execute his strokes properly with most going wide and long. After a pep talk with coach Pullela Gopichand, Srikanth came back strongly in the second game.He looked more aggressive and his approach earned him dividends as he forced the match into the decider after winning 21-14.In the third game, Srikanth was comfortably placed at 11-6 but Leverdez made fantastic recovery to make it 12-12. The duo fought hard and moved neck and neck till 18-18. Leverdez then won a long rally to grab a 19-18 advantage but Srikanth drew parity.The Frenchman held a match point but the Indian once again levelled par and grabbed a match point, before managing to convert it.Sindhu, on the other hand, blew a 11-4 advantage in the opening game as Pornpawee fought back to catch up with the Indian at 14-14. She went to the 20-18 game point advantage before Sindhu clawed back but in the end it was the Thai shuttle who pocketed the game.Jolted by the reversal, Sindhu surged to a 14-6 and 15-7 lead in the next two games and didn’t lose control despite some spirited fight by Pornpawee.Saina, who had reached the final in the 2015 edition, couldn’t match up to the precision and athleticism of Tai Tzu and went down 14-21 18-21. It was Saina’s eighth successive loss to the Taiwanese wizard in five years.Among others, Ashwini Ponnappa and N Sikki Reddy lost 14-21 13-21 to second seed Japanese combo of Misaki Matsutomo and Ayaka Takahashi, while Jakkampudi Meghana and Poorvisha S Ram went down 14-21 11-21 to fifth seed Japanese combo of Shiho Tanaka and Koharu Yonemoto 21-14 21-11 in women’s doubles.Men’s doubles pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy also suffered a 20-22 12-21 loss against English combo of Marcus Ellis and Chris Langride to crash out.After failing to keep pace with Tai Tzu in the opening game, the 27-year-old Indian blew a 16-11 advantage in the second game to bow out of the USD 1,000,000 world Super 1000 tournament.Saina, who had lost to Tai Tzu in the final of the Indonesia Masters early this year, showed a lot of grit to keep herself in the rallies but the Taiwanese was simply phenomenal and displayed her mastery of strokes in the 38-minute clash to once again outwit the Indian.Saina took some time to get in the groove as her first serve sailed over to the back of the court. Tai Tzu didn’t waste time and jumped to a 3-1 lead before moving to a 6-2 advantage when the Indian failed to connect a low backhand return.Tai Tzu committed a couple of unforced errors but Saina also made a judgement error on the sidelines and also couldn’t reach for a return at the forecourt as the Taiwanese lead 9-4.The Indian, however, grabbed three consecutive points after Tai Tzu erred with a cross court flick and netted the smash. Saina managed to level 10-10 with a precise cross court return from the back of the court butTai Tzu went into the break with a slender one- point lead.The duo moved together till 14-14 after the breather before Tai Tzu showed her repertoire of shots even as Saina struggled with her control. Once she again went wide on a return on serve, Tai Tzu had six game points and she grabbed it with another accurate return on the Indian’s back hand.In the second game, Saina showed better control as she opened up a 3-1 lead and soon made it 10-7 with Tai suffering a mid-game slump with unforced errors. Saina then unleashed a brutal smash to enter the break with three point advantage.With the Taiwanese sending the shuttle to the net on four occasions on the trot, Saina managed to lead 16-11. But Tai Tzu once again fought back, riding on her accurate stroke play as she made the Indian run across the court with her acute angled returns.Saina also found the net and sent one long as Tai Tzu narrowed the gap to 15-16 before drawing parity at 17-17 with another razor-sharp cross court return from the back court.A brilliant block on the move and then a tight net play took the Taiwanese to 20-18 and she shut the door on the Indian after Saina went long again.', 'California: Indian tennis ace Yuki Bhambri’s strong run at the Indian Wells Masters came to an end after he went down against America’s Sam Querrey in the three-set thriller of the third round of the tournament on Wednesday.Though the Indian qualifier put up a gritty show in a close encounter, he failed to capitalize on his first-set win and eventually slumped to a 7-6(4), 4-6, 4-6 defeat at the hands of 18th seed Querrey in the third round of the men’s singles event that lasted two hours and 22 minutes.Querrey will now be up against with the winner of another third round encounter between America’s Jack Sock and Spain’s Feliciano Lopez. In another men’s singles clash, sixth-seed Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina made it to the fourth round of the tournament after sweeping aside David Ferrer of Spain in straight sets.Del Potro posted a 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) win over Ferrer to set up a clash against his countryman Leonardo Mayer for a place in the quarter-finals.', 'Gandhinagar: Expressing deep anguish over a spate of banking frauds, RBI Governor Urjit Patel has said that like the ‘Neelakantha’ (Lord Shiva), he will do everything possible to clean the rot in the Indian banking system and to make it more transparent and efficient.“If we need to face the brickbats and be the Neelakantha consuming this poison, we will do so as our duty,” Patel said.”The central bank will persist with its endeavours and get better with each trial and tribulation,” the RBI Governor added.Patel made these remarks while delivering a lecture at the Gujarat National Law University on Wednesday.During his speech, Patel said, ”Banking frauds amount to the looting of our country’s future by some in the business community in cahoots with some lenders.”He, however, pledged to break the unholy nexus between businessmen and bankers.”As the guard of people’s deposits at banks, I will do my best to break the unholy nexus,” he said.Referring to the Rs 12,967 crore scam at PNB, he said, “I have chosen to speak today to convey that we at the Reserve Bank of India also feel the anger, hurt and pain at the banking sector frauds and irregularities.”Patel said RBI has in place an asset quality review of banks and “we are doing all we can to further strengthen it”.Patel’s comments came come almost a month after India’s second-largest lender, state-owned Punjab National Bank was allegedly defrauded of around Rs 13,000 crore by billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi in connivance with some bank employees.', 'London: Britain is to kick out 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest such expulsion since the Cold War, over a chemical attack on a former Russian double agent in England that Prime Minister Theresa May blamed on Moscow, an assessment backed by the United States.May pointed the finger firmly at Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday as she outlined retaliatory measures in parliament.Russia denies any involvement in the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who have been critical in hospital since they were found unconscious on March 4 on a bench in the city of Salisbury.May announced the potential freezing of Russian state assets that pose a security threat, new laws to counter hostile state activity and a downgrading of Britain`s attendance at the soccer World Cup in Russia this summer.She had given Moscow until midnight on Tuesday to explain how the Soviet-made Novichok nerve agent came to be deployed on the streets of Salisbury, saying either the Russian state was responsible or had lost control of a stock of the substance.“Their response demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events,” May said in her statement to parliament. “They have treated the use of a military-grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm, contempt and defiance.”The only possible conclusion was that the Russian state was behind the attempted murder of the Skripals and the harm that befell Nick Bailey, a police officer who is in a serious condition after being exposed to the nerve agent, May said.“This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,” she said.The Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow would swiftly retaliate against the British measures which had been undertaken for “short-sighted political ends”.“The British government has made a choice in favour of confrontation with Russia,” it said.Russia’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, repeated Moscow’s denial that it had anything to do with the poisoning and called for proof of its involvement.MAY DENOUNCES PUTINThe two governments blamed each other for the crisis.“Many of us looked at a post-Soviet Russia with hope. We wanted a better relationship and it is tragic that President Putin has chosen to act in this way,” said May.Britain, which has received statements of support from the United States, the European Union and NATO, has said it would seek to coordinate an international response to the attack.The White House issued a statement saying it shared Britain’s assessment that Russia was responsible and supported May’s decision to expel the diplomats “as a just response.” It was the White House`s most unequivocal statement to date blaming Russia for the poisoning.At the United Nations, US Ambassador Nikki Haley blamed Russia for the attack and urged the Security Council to take “immediate, concrete measures to address this now.”In a phone call between May and US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, the two leaders agreed that Russia must provide “unambiguous answers” about how a Russian-developed chemical agent came to be used in the attack. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she took the British findings seriously and there would be a common European stance, although “we must still talk responsibly” with Russia despite differences of opinion.A French government spokesman said Paris was awaiting proof before deciding if it would act in solidarity with London.Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to Britain before being arrested in Moscow and later jailed in 2006. He was freed under a spy swap deal in 2010 and took refuge in Britain.The attack on him was likened in Britain to the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of Putin, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium 210. Russia refused to extradite the two Russians identified by Britain as the killers.Britain’s response to the Litvinenko affair, which included the expulsion of four Russian diplomats, was criticised domestically as too weak, and many in British politics and media have called for a much tougher response to the Skripal attack.Some Russia experts cast doubt over whether May’s actions met that test.“This is certainly not a strong response from Britain – it is a mild response,” said Mathieu Boulegue, a Russia expert at Chatham House think-tank in London. “It will not deter Russia because Britain is showing too little steel.”\\nMay said the 23 diplomats, identified as undeclared intelligence officers, had one week to leave and Russian intelligence capabilities in Britain would be damaged for years.May also said Britain would revoke an invitation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to visit and suspend planned high level bilateral contacts between London and Moscow. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said Lavrov had not accepted the invitation to visit Britain anyway.On the soccer World Cup, which Russia is hosting in June and July, May said no ministers or members of the British royal family would attend.CORRUPT ELITESBut unlike when the United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea, May did not name Russian people or companies that would be specifically targeted by sanctions.She said checks on private flights, customs and freight would be stepped up to better track those travelling to Britain who could represent a security threat.London has been a venue of choice for many rich Russian to buy property and the in-flow of Russian money has led to the capital being nicknamed “Londongrad”.Russian gas giant Gazprom will cut hundreds of jobs at its overseas trading and export offices, including Britain where it has its largest such office by far, and move them to St Petersburg, as part of a drive by Putin to repatriate capital to reduce exposure to sanctions, according to two sources familiar with the plan.In a separate development, British media regulator Ofcom said it could strip Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded TV channel, of its UK licence. Russia has said British media would be expelled in retaliation should that happen.', 'New Delhi: India takes nuclear non-proliferation very seriously and unlike some of its neighbours, it does not believe in “dirty bombs”, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday, in an oblique reference to Pakistan.Sitharaman, while speaking at a book release function in Delhi, said India is complying with nuclear non-proliferation regulations despite not being a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty (NPT).“We are signing nuclear treaties as a commitment to non-proliferation and are not supportive of illegal spread,” she said.“Unlike some of our neighbours, India does not believe in dirty bombs, we take non-proliferation very seriously,” she said.Sitharaman also said infiltration bids from across the border with Pakistan have not come down.“We are remaining alert, we will not entertain infiltration,” she said.On the issue of rising terrorism-related incidents in Kashmir, the minister said the government is working with the state government to deal with the issue.Efforts are going on and government is engaged, she said, referring to the visits of the centre’s interlocutor who has been engaging with different sections of people in the state.She said India does not want an escalation in tensions, but it is for Pakistan to prove that their territory is not being used for terrorism.', 'New Delhi: The Budget Session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly will begin from Friday. The budget session will conclude on March 28.A decision to this effect was taken by the Delhi cabinet on Thursday.The decision was taken during a meeting attended by CM Arvind Kejriwal and Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash.This was the first official meeting attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and chief secretary Anshu Prakash after their controversial midnight meeting at the former’s residence. Finance secretary SN Sahay and GAD secretary MK Parida also attended the meeting. “The Budget Session will commence from 16 March and conclude on March 28,” a statement from the government said.Being the first session of the year, Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor will address the Assembly on 16.03.2018 at 11.00 am. The formal sitting of the House will commence at 2.00 pm.Discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor will be held on 19th and 20th March, 2018.The budget will be delivered by Deputy CM Manish Sisodia who also holds the finance portfolio.Sisodia will also present the Economic Survey in the Assembly, followed by the Outcome Budget.The Budget Session itself is expected to be a fiery affair and with the ongoing sealing drive in the city, AAP spokesperson has said his party will bring up the matter in the session as well. This could possibly further add fuel to the political fire.It is important to note that last year, the Delhi government had presented a Rs 48,000-crore tax-free budget for Delhi with a special focus on education, transport, health and water distribution. At the time, Sisodia had said that due to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST), no new taxes were added. It would be interesting to see if the state government continues with the same line of thought in its fourth budget presentation.(With Agency inputs)', 'Washington: Despite the United States pressuring Pakistan, the Islamabad Government is still supporting the Taliban terrorist group in the border region with Afghanistan, revealed United State Army General Joseph L Votel.According to the Washington Times, during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, when asked about the continued Pakistani support to Taliban, Gen Votel noted, “I cannot tell you that we have seen decisive changes in the areas in which we’re working, but I remain very well-engaged with my partner to ensure that we are moving forward on this.”On recent increase in Taliban attacks in Afghanistan, Votel said, “Having sanctuary in Pakistan or having support from other actors in the region certainly is an aspect of the Taliban’s success here.”The Washington Times report further quoted an intelligence source close to the Afghan border region as saying that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan is continuing its covert support for the Taliban in the border region.“ISI is providing both protection and material support to the Taliban in areas between Quetta and the Afghan border,” the source said.The insider revealed that the ISI is working along with the Pakistani Army in Taliban in Pashtun ethnic areas of Balochistan province in the northwestern part of the country.“In Pashtun areas which are close to Quetta, religious groups are operating madrasas” – Islamic schools, the source said. “Among these groups, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam is most active. Under Sami ul Haq’s leadership, madrasas are creating new soldiers for Taliban in Balochistan’s Pashtun belt.” Maulana Sami ul Haq is a Pakistani cleric regarded as “the father of the Taliban.”“We believe top Taliban leadership are operating from Pashtunabad, Gulistan and surrounding areas,” the source added.The report highlighted that Taliban is working with the ISI in another small border district called Killa Abdullah, about 44 miles from Quetta, capital of Balochistan.In that area, Taliban fighters have been spotted along “with automatic weapons either in motorbikes, or [in] four-by-four vehicles along with two to five companions,” the source said.The source further revealed that the local police is not allowed to stop the Taliban fighters from travelling from Afghanistan to Pakistan.“These people freely travel in Quetta, Chaman and all surrounding areas,” the source said. “Civilian [police] forces cannot intervene because they work under ISI and military apparatus. The police are also powerless and are afraid for their own security.” ', 'London: Virendra Sharma, a Labour party MP, has reportedly written to British Prime Minister Theresa May, urging her to consider inclusion of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in the country’s school history curriculum.Virendra Sharma is a veteran Indian-origin British MP for Ealing Southall.Sharma has been campaigning for the historic episode to be commemorated in the UK and had raised the issue during Prime Ministers Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday.He got a written assurance from Theresa May in this regard.“I was pleased to ask the Prime Minister about her plans to commemorate the Amritsar massacre, and delighted that she will look more closely at the matter,” he said.“I believe it is important that everyone in the UK is aware of this countrys colonial heritage, and that schoolchildren should be taught about the more shocking aspects of our history,” he said.“I have written to the Prime Minister about my campaign for a permanent memorial and for the Amritsar massacre to be included in the school curriculum. I look forward to meeting her to discuss positive steps we can take,” Sharma said.The 70-year-old parliamentarian has previously campaigned for an apology from the British government over the atrocity on April 13, 1919, when General Dyer ordered his troops to open fire on thousands of unarmed protesters gathered at Jallianwala Bagh.During his Indian Trade Mission in February 2013, the Prime Minister David Cameron had said it would be wrong to “reach back into history” and apologise for the wrongs of British colonialism.The UK Foreign Office has stood by that view in its stand on the matter.“As the former Prime Minister said when he visited the Jallianwala Bagh in 2013, the massacre was a deeply shameful act in British history and one that we should never forget. It is right that we pay respect to those who lost their lives and remember what happened. The British Government rightly condemned the events at the time,” the UK FO says.Sharma is hopeful that his campaign for a permanent memorial and for the subject to be included in the school curriculum will bear fruit in time for next months 99th anniversary of the massacre. (With PTI inputs)  ', 'Islamabad: Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed has filed a petition in the Lahore High Court challenging the Pakistan government’s ban on his social welfare activities.According to reports, the JuD chief has challenged the ban imposed by the Interior Ministry of Pakistan on his outfits – JuD and charity organisation Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation (FiF).Saeed has filed the petition through his counsel advocate AK Dogar. He submitted to the LHC that the Interior Ministry on February 10 issued a notification with regard to the freezing of bank accounts and taking over assets associated with the JUD and FiF under the Anti-Terrorism (amendment) Ordinance 2018.“The government of Pakistan acted under the pressure of foreign powers, including UN and India,” he said and contended that Pakistan is a sovereign independent state and makes its own laws to govern its citizens.“If there is a conflict between the laws of the land and any provision of United Nations Security Counsel Act, 1948, the law of the land shall prevail,” he said.The LeT co-founder further said the FiF owns 369 ambulances, helped 72,000 persons to charity hospitals and treated 600,000 patients only in 2017.“JuD dug out 2000 wells for supplying water in Tharparkar, Baluchistan and Balochistan,” he claimed in his plea.Saeed has pleaded to the court to declare the impugned notification of the Interior Ministry null and void with regard to taking over the assets of the organisations.Separately, Saeed had last week challenged the presidential ordinance under which his group has been banned for being on the watch-list of the United Nations in the Islamabad High Court.President Mamnoon Hussain last month promulgated an ordinance amending the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 with regards to proscription of terrorist individuals and organisations to include entities listed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) – in a move to declare Hafiz Saeed-linked JuD and Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) as proscribed groups.Saeed, who is accused of having masterminded the November 2008 Mumbai attack, was placed on the terrorism blacklist by the United Nations in December 2008.The banned JUD head was released from the house arrest in November last year after the Pakistan government decided against detaining him further in any other case. He was under house arrest since January last year.

However, the Indian Air Force has now committed to buy at least123 Tejas fighter jets at the cost of Rs 75,000 crore from the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).The IAF, however, demands that the Tejas Mark II jets should be entirely “new fighters” with “better avionics, radars, enhanced weapons carrying capacity and powerful engines”. “The Tejas Mark-II is still on the drawing board. But if DRDO, Aeronautical Development Agency and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd deliver the required Mark-II fighter, IAF has agreed to have a total of 18 Tejas squadrons,” a highly-placed source was quoted as saying by the Times of India.According to report, the IAF has already issued the request for proposal (RFP) to the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the acquisition of 83 fighters which are scheduled to join the IAF from 2019-20 after completion of Final Operational Clearance (FOC) contract for 20 Tejas jests.The existing single-engine Tejas has limited “endurance” of just an hour, with a “radius of action” of only 350-400-km and weapon-carrying capacity of 3-tonne. While the other single-engine fighters such as Swedish Gripen-E have triple the endurance and double the weapon-carrying capacity.IAF’s readiness to buy more LCA jets is based on its assessment that buying and inducting expensive foreign fighters “in large numbers” is simply not an option. This comes after a series of recent top-level meetings in South Block during which Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that government is “not ditching” the home-grown Tejas and “putting all its energies” into ensuring the fighter is delivered at a much faster pace.Being critical of the fighter jets, the IAF had said, “Tejas, which has just about 50% of the capabilities of an F-16 or Gripen in terms of endurance, payload etc, will have to fly under the protection of other fighters during conflicts.”The IAF has earlier reportedly informed the Centre that Tejas – India’s first domestically designed and produced light fighter aircraft – has several deficiencies and lags behind its foreign competitors like the JAS-39 Gripen.In July 2017, the IAF inducted the first squadron of home-grown Tejas with two fighter planes joining the force. The squadron named – Flying Daggers 45 – is expected to have its full strength by 2018-2020. However, the IAF was not eager to expand its Tejas unit.', 'Mumbai: Moviegoers are eagerly looking forward to the release of\\xa0Mahanati, a biopic on legendary actress Savitri. The multilingual film directed by Nag Ashwin will star Keerthy Suresh (as Savitri), Dulquer Salmaan (as Gemini Ganesan), Samantha Ruth Prabhu (as Jamuna), Anushka Shetty (as Bhanumati) and Naga Chaitanya (Akkineni Nageshwara Rao).The makers haven’t yet revealed the looks of the characters in the film but a photograph of Dulquer and Keerthy as Gemini and Savitri respectively has surfaced online.It looks like a poster made by a fan but given the fact that it’s a biopic and set in the 1950s, expect Dulquer and Keerthy to sport a look that was popular in that era.Check out the photo which has been doing the rounds on social media:Mahanati\\xa0which is being made in Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam languages is one of the most awaited films.Dulquer, son of Malayalam superstar Mammooty, is excited to be a part of\\xa0Mahanati. Talking about it during an interview in September last year, he said, “Amazing period is being captured in films and even in TV series in the West. For long, I have desired to be part of a period drama. Unfortunately, in the Malayalam film industry, we don’t have huge budgets to make such films. ‘Mahanati’ is being made on a massive scale and I’m lucky to be part of this project.”On playing Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan in the film, Dulquer said: “I’m not going to look like him. I can’t, honestly, and I don’t want to wear prosthetic. My approach is simple. I would like to be me in the 1950s if I was a big movie star.”“I don’t think I should attempt to play Gemini Ganesan. You don’t really have any off-screen footage of him. You don’t know what kind of person he was off-screen. We only know his persona on screen and I can’t use that to play him off-screen,” he added.Keerthy had to gain weight to shoot some important portions of the film which went on the floors in May last year.Born on January 4, 1936, Savitri made her acting debut in 1950 Telugu-Tamil drama Samsaram, and went on to star in several classics such as\\xa0Devadasu, Missamma, Penin Perumai, Pasa Malar, Bhale Ramudu, Thodi Kodallu, Mayabazaar\\xa0and\\xa0Gundamma Katha.', 'Paul W.S. Anderson is known for creating the most frenzied upon and successful franchise of Resident Evil movies is in conversation with us. He shares his journey of 15 years of making Resident Evil movies working with wife Milla, and also about his love for Bollywood movies. Watch the latest part of the franchise, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter on March 24 at 9.30 AM on Sony PIX.You have managed to pull off 6 resident evil movies, what do you think it is about the movie that has resonated with so many people?\\nI think we make good movies. That is the most important thing as these movies were made with a lot of love, care and attention. People tend to appreciate such movies which were made from heart and there are many reasons the movie resonates with so many people. One of them being that we made 6 different kinds of movies, if you look at the movies the one thing that the franchise didn’t do was stand still at one concept. It constantly evolved and changed and tried to deliver a kind of different experience for each movie within the world of Resident Evil to the people who were watching them. From the first frame to the last frame Milla was on the run from the forces of the Chris Redfield and the Umbrella Corporation. So each movie is kind of being structured, shot and delivered in a different kind of way which has kept the experience fresh which is why we have continued this series for a 15 year period. People felt that each of the experience was different and not rehashed from previous movies. What is it like to work with your wife on the sets? What are the pros and cons of it?\\nThere are only pros to it. Milla is an amazing committed actress and any director who gets to work with her is a very lucky man or woman. She is a real asset to the production. She has a lot of enthusiasm and passion towards what she does.When it comes to adapting a movie based on a video game, what challenges did you face?\\nI think the biggest challenge is to please the displaced audience, there is a group of people who are hardcore fans and know everything about the game Resident Evil and then there is the more mainstream who don’t know anything about the video game so you have to deliver a movie appeals to both these groups of people because if you make it too much for the hardcore fans then the mainstream audience will feel excluded to a point that they would not think that such a movie is not for them. Also, if you don’t put enough efforts for the hardcore fans they feel bad that the adaptation isn’t true enough. So one has to really walk a fine line between the two and it’s difficult to do and that’s why most of the game adaptation don’t really work. As a genre they have more failures than successes.How has Milla shaped “Alice” over all six movies? How has she evolved as an actress through the sequels?\\nOne thing about Milla consistently is that she has been amazing to work with. We have done so many things together over the years. Every time I ask her to stand in the middle of a freezing cold street in a sub zero temperatures when we make it rain on her and she is freezing and is in great physical discomfort. I always felt terrible and apologised to her and her usual answer is don’t worry you have done much worse to me. One of the nice things is that she has evolved as an actress, as a person over that period of time. She had children which have made her kind of a protective mother lion character and I think it has a fierceness to her which was maybe missing when we started making the movies. For me, she has become a better actress as well and now she is this terrific actress whose depth of the performance has found new ways to deepen over the years. The great thing about her is that she is really committed which is what you need in a movie like this because there a lot of zombies who are not really scary. She makes the movies work and they would work if it wasn’t for her core performance.What are your thoughts on Indian cinema and Indian actors?\\nI was exposed to Indian culture very young, although I grew up in North England but my best friend since then and still my best friend is an Indian who moved to England with his parents. Some of my earliest memories like, his mum and dad giving me a lift and always listening to cassette player playing Bollywood music and we also would watch Bollywood movies. So I grew exposed to Bollywood very early and I really liked it because there is a real flamboyant energy to it. I am really led by the visuals, energy and by flamboyance in the movies I watch and I think those three words pretty much describe the Bollywood cinema.', 'Mumbai: American Pop-Rock Band OneRepublic is set to perform live on April 21 in Mumbai’s MMRDA Grounds, announced event management company, Opium Events.Fans can expect to hear a span of OneRepublic’s biggest songs, from ‘Apologize’ to ‘Secrets,’ ‘Good Life,’ the smash hit ‘Counting Stars’ and more recently released singles from the latest album ‘Oh My My’.

British Prime Minister Theresa May promised a “united stance” as she visited the scene of the attack for the first time on Thursday, a day after saying Moscow was “culpable” and expelling 23 Russian diplomats among other measures.In a rare joint statement, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and the US condemned the attack as an “assault on UK sovereignty”.“We share the UK assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation, and note that Russia’s failure to address the legitimate request by the UK government further underlines its responsibility,” the statement said.The four leaders called on Russia to provide “full and complete disclosure” of the Soviet-era chemical programme that developed Novichok, the statement published by the British government said.Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Britain’s position “absolutely irresponsible”. He warned that retaliatory steps would soon follow and President Vladimir Putin would choose the option that “most suits Moscow’s interests”.

The lawsuit alleges that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, began an “intimate relationship” with Trump in the summer of 2006 that continued well into 2007.A copy of the settlement filed in court shows that Daniels received the USD 130,000 from a company known as Essential Consultants LLC in return for her silence.Later on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal published details of an arbitration document filed on February 22 in California and signed by Jill A Martin, a Trump Organization lawyer.The document, intended to stop Daniels from further discussing the alleged affair, represents the first link between Trump’s company and efforts to stop Daniels talking.The White House has denied any sexual encounter between Trump and Daniels who has offered to return the USD 130,000 she received so that she can be free to “speak openly and freely about her prior relationship with the president and the attempts to silence her.”She is also asking to be allowed to publish text messages, photos and videos relating to the president, Avenatti said in a letter to Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen.“I think it’s time for her to tell her story and for the public to decide who’s telling the truth,” Avenatti said last week.Using the pseudonyms Peggy Peterson and David Dennison, Daniels and Trump were to sign the 2016 agreement, along with Essential Consultants.But Trump never signed, providing the basis for Avenatti’s attempt to have it thrown out and release Daniels from her obligations.Daniels is asking for presiding judge Elizabeth Feffer to be replaced, arguing that she has a conflict of interest because she is seeking an appointment to a seat in federal court.', 'Jammu: Security forces on Friday recovered the bodies of two terrorists who were killed in an encounter in Srinagar’s Khanmoh are in Jammu and Kashmir.A large cache of arms and other incriminating material has also been seized from the slain terrorists.A case has been registered in this regard and investigations are on.Two terrorists were killed and three policemen including an SHO injured on Thursday in a gunfight that broke out on the outskirts of the Srinagar city after a BJP leader was attacked.The gunfight between the security forces and terrorists took place in Balhama area of Khonmoh in outskirts of Srinagar.Terrorists had attacked BJP leader, Muhammad Anwar Khan, and injured his security guard Bilal Ahmad after which they fled and took shelter in Balhama village.Security personnel immediately surrounded the village and a gunfight started there.

India has been a key partner in the development of the port which is easily accessible from India’s western coast and is increasingly seen as a counter to Pakistan’s Gwadar Port, being developed with Chinese investment.“As you are aware, India is supporting the development of Chahbahar Port as a robust and alternate access route to and for Afghanistan and Central Asia,” said Kumar, adding significant progress has been made in operationalising the port.In November last year, India delivered the first consignment of wheat to Afghanistan through the Chabahar Port.“Shipment of wheat assistance to Afghanistan through Chahbahar is being successfully carried out since October last year. Four such shipments have been successfully delivered,” said Kumar.He said India’s assistance for building Chabahar-Zahedan Railway to realise the full potential of the port and to connect it to Afghanistan and Central Asia was discussed during Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to New Delhi in February.“We continue to work with Iran on the full and effective operationalisation of the Chabahar Port,” said Kumar.India, Iran and Afghanistan had signed a trilateral agreement in 2016 to jointly develop the Chabahar port.', 'New Delhi: Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal has apparently settled the defamation case filed against him by former Punjab Revenue Minister Bikram Singh Majithia by tendering an apology to the latter in connection with his alleged role in the drug trade in Punjab.However, questions are now being asked if Kejriwal will settle another defamation suit filed against the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley with whom he is locked in a bitter legal battle.Kejriwal had on Thursday issued an apology to Majithia, saying that now he has learnt that the drug trade allegations were unfounded.“In the recent past, I made certain statements and allegations against you regarding your alleged involvement in drug trade.

It was in a sugar factory in Palakkad, where he managed to get work after completing high school, that young Sukumaran was exposed to the “thankless toil” of the workers, and was soon caught up in the Communist movement that swept the state during the post-Independence period.With his strong pro-Left leanings, Sukumaran guaranteed for himself a tumultuous life and career.

By then his short stories, few and far between, that reflected the unrest of the marginalised shaped a unique modernist sensibility in Malayalam literature. And then, almost two decades later, frustrated by the CPM’s vagrant ways, he vehemently criticised its decadence in his celebrated 1981 short story ‘Sheshakriya’. The story landed right on target and Sukumaran was promptly ousted from the CPM. The writer responded with a resounding silence. He stopped writing for over a decade. Sukumaran returned to writing in 1992, with Pithrutharppanam. Later, in 2006, his novel Chuvana Adayalangal won the Kendra Sahithya Academy award.

Washington believes the groups use Pakistan as a safe haven for launching attacks on neighbouring Afghanistan. Pakistan, however, denies helping the militants.The United States has been at war in Afghanistan since 2001, making it America’s longest military conflict.

I am a strict father sometimes, but I also pamper my children a lot,” reveals Ajay, who credits his success to his father, stuntman Veeru Devgn.“Yes! I am here only because of my dad. That action sequence in my debut film Phool Aur Kante (1991), where I balance myself on two cars running parallel to one another, was choreographed by him, like so many other action scenes. People whistled and hooted and the film became a hit at the box-office. There has been no looking back for me since,” recalls the actor fondly.', 'Vidya Balan paid a visit to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) on Tuesday, after being appointed as a core member. The actress was there to head a revising committee screening for the satellite screening issue of the English film Token. This happens to be the first time that she has headed a revising committee. Reveals a source, “Vidyaji was there to view the film, and they certified it. She had a good time with the team, and also clicked pictures with them, as well as other members of the CBFC. Later, she also viewed a few film trailers that had come in for certification.” The actress had recently told us about her role. “A lot of people don’t know what it means to be a board member. We don’t watch all of the movies. Only when there’s a problem do we see the film,” she had said. Apart from Vidya, known names like Vivek Agnihotri, Vani Tripathi Tikoo, Mihir Bhuta and others were also made a part of the new CBFC team headed by Prasoon Joshi, after he became the chief following Pahlaj Nihalani’s unceremonious sacking. ', 'CHENNAI: India’s latest golf sensation, Shubhankar Sharma, believes winning an Olympic medal would change the profile of the sport in the country. “The public will relate to an Olympic medal than a victory at the Masters or an European Tour event. Like it happened in badminton, a medal from the Games will have a bigger impact in the country. But for a professional golfer, winning a Major is the ultimate,” said Shubhankar who is riding on a crest of a wave after his recent exploits at the World Golf Championship in Mexico where he led a star-studded field before finishing tied ninth.It’s no surprise that the 21-year-old, too, has an Olympic dream like many other sportspersons. “I am looking forward to the 2020 Olympics, although it is still a long way away. Representing the country at the Olympics would be a dream-come-true. A medal will be even better. First, I have to make it there and keep playing well. I think, the 2020 Games will come at the right phase for me. I will be mature enough to have played at the highest level. I will probably play on the PGA Tour for a few weeks and hopefully I can make my card,” added Shubhankar.  Even though the country has been consistently producing world-class players, golf hasn’t really appealed to the masses. The 21-year-old feels golf can shed the tag of an elite sport only with help of the government. “Now that it’s an Olympic sport, the government needs to do more. We need more ranges and more funding. We have time and again shown that we can produce world-class players in India such as Anirban Lahiri and Arjun Atwal, Jeev Milkha Singh et al. There is no dearth of talent in the country. We just need more support and golf needs to be introduced in schools. I believe we will have a Major champion very soon,” he added. Shubhankar also spoke on a variety of subjects during a golf clinic organised by Take Solutions.Cut his golf tooth at Ooty (Tamil Nadu)\\nI started when I was seven years old. My dad, an army officer, was posted in Wellington (Ooty, Tamil Nadu). That was the first time I went to a golf course. Nobody in my family had played it before. I got hooked to the game immediately. I was there for one year and then my dad had to move to Bhopal. In 2004, I played my first tournament. I never really looked back since then. A big Barcelona fan\\nI follow a lot of other sports; not much cricket though. I don’t really follow IPL. I am a big fan of football. Barcelona are my favourite team. And, I follow their matches as much as I can. There are only two teams — Barcelona and Real Madrid — who play well in La Liga! The champions league is a lot more exciting. Even when I went to Barcelona last year, I made it a point that I went to Camp Nou. I was there for the entire day. Now that I will be playing on the European Tour, I will probably go and see a few EPL matches. Would have become a tennis player if not for golf\\nOne sportsman I would love to meet is Roger Federer. He is an absolute legend. I would also like to meet Messi and Ronaldo, but I like the individual sport more.\\nI think I would have become a tennis player if not a golfer. I have been a big fan of Wimbledon and I hardly miss watching it on TV. High regard for Tiger\\nWithin two hours after I returned from the Mexico event, I got a call from the organisers of the Augusta Masters. It was a great moment. It’s the ultimate destination golfers dream of. I was really happy as it was unexpected. You can equate this to getting into the Olympics. I have watched the Masters on TV for so many years and going there will be a great feeling. Tiger Woods will be playing this year. I have never played with him, but I met him when he came to India. The tournament will be much bigger with Tiger’s presence. Tiger is like the God in our eyes. It’s great for the game that he is coming back. He shot four-under yesterday at Arnold Palmer. His game looks solid. I hope he wins soon. Tiger pulls in crowds like no one else. The TRPs shoot up when he enters a tournament. He puts pressure on himself\\nSince I am not a cricketer, I don’t think people expects me to do well everywhere! There are no expectations from fans. Any expectation is just from myself. I know I am playing well, but at the same time I keep in mind that golf is not an easy sport. You just have to stay consistent. Sky is the limit and I know that my best is enough to compete at any level. I always knew that I had what it takes to reach there. But I  didn’t know that it would happen so fast. There was so much media frenzy during the Mexico event. It was a completely a new environment and I was not used to it. But I thought I handled myself really well. You have to be very cool in golf. You go through a lot of highs and lows, but you can’t show it. At the same time, each player is unique on the Tour when it comes to temperament. I prefer to be calm. I also like to celebrate, but you have to be very efficient in managing your emotions. You should know how to get back to level zero after a brilliant hole or a shot. Temperament wise, I always look up to Tiger. Excited about the President’s Cup\\nI will be playing under Ernie Els in the International team. Tiger will be the US captain. It is one of the biggest rivalries in golf. I am sure that it will be one of the best President’s Cup ever. Just being a part of it will be amazing. Everyone has a chance to make it. The beauty of golf is that you can rise suddenly. I was in the 500s a few months ago and now I am ranked 64th in the world. So I hope to play my best golf before the tournament and get into the team.Fitness is key\\nIt’s not easy to remain fit. For a golfer, you must have strong muscles in certain areas. Travelling a lot doesn’t help our cause. Thats why it’s important to go to the gym, especially after you land in a new city. I do a lot of flexibility exercise, but they are very different to what other athletes do. Tiger is a pioneer when it comes to fitness in golf. Now, everyone is fit.', 'Birmingham: Ace Indian shuttler PV Sindhu on Friday came back from one game down to beat Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara 20-22, 21-18, 21-18 in the quarterfinals of the All England Championships, thereby advancing to the semifinals.It was a well-fought contest between the two shuttlers as Sindhu completed yet another promising comeback. Fellow Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal had earlier been knocked out of the tournament in the first round itself, whereas Kidambi Srikanth too bowed out of the tournament in the pre-quarterfinals.Earlier, the Indian entered the last eight after outplaying Thailand’s Nitchaon Jindapol 21-13, 13-21, 21-18 in over 66 minutes.While PV Sindhu defeated Okuhara in the final of the BWF Korea Open Super Series in September last year, she had lost to the Japanese shuttler in straight games in the second round of the Japan Open Super Series.', 'New Delhi: A day after Telugu Desam Party (TDP) quit NDA over lack of financial support, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said the Centre was committed to giving Andhra Pradesh a special package equivalent to a special category state and has been endlessly waiting for the state government to revert on mechanism of receiving it.Jaitley said the modalities of giving the special package were agreed way back in September 2016 but the state government only in January this year suggested a change in route of receiving funds, to which the Centre agreed but has not heard from it ever since. “A solution has been put on the table. It is for Andhra Pradesh to decide whether they want the resources or they want to make an issue (out of it),” he told news agency PTI in New Delhi.The TDP, which has 16 MPs in the 545-member Lok Sabha, first pulled out its ministers from the Narendra Modi government and on Thursday decided to quit the alliance itself.The party, which is in power in Andhra Pradesh, had been demanding greater financial assistance to make up for the disadvantage it has been put to since its division in 2014.Jaitley, however, said the Centre has been fully committed to giving the promised funds to the state and there has been no delay on its part. He said the so-called special category status cannot be given to Andhra Pradesh in its literal sense after implementation of the award of 14th Finance Commission, which deals with sharing of central government’s financial resources with the states.The constitutionally-mandated Commission gave increased share of states fund in central taxes to 42 per cent from 32 per cent previously and meeting revenue deficit in case any state needs to be extraordinarily compensated.The Union Minister said a special category state gets to pay just 10 per cent share of the money to be spent on a centrally sponsored scheme in comparison to general category states having to pay 40 per cent. The remaining 90 per cent in case of special category states and 60 per cent in general category states is borne by the Centre.The 30 per cent equivalent advantage that the special category states had was agreed to be given to Andhra Pradesh for five years.“We found a solution on September 16, 2016 that instead of a special category, we will give a special package,” he said adding the funds equivalent to 30 per cent additional funding was to be met in some other form.Andhra Pradesh, he said, suggested that this should come to it in form of external aided projects wherein the repayment is 90 per cent borne by the Centre and 10 per cent by the state.“We agreed,” he said.But in January this year, Andhra Pradesh changed its stance and said it should come via NABARD, Jaitley said adding the Centre told the state that such funding would increase its fiscal deficit and restrict borrowing space. So it was suggested that a special purpose vehicle be created into which NABARD can transfer funds. The Centre would have repaid such funds to the extent of 90 per cent, he said.“On February 7 their officers said they will find out the details and come. No one has come till now,” he said.“We have been literally waiting for them to come.”“The Centre has always been willing to give and there is no delay on our part,” he said.“The changeover has been done in January by Andhra Pradesh not by us.”On meeting the revenue deficit faced by the state due to carving out of Telangana, Jaitley said 14th Finance Commission has already calculated the funds for 2015 to 2020, which the Centre will pay.For the 10 months prior to that, the deficit can be calculated either by taking the 2013-14 as the base or by extrapolating revenue of 2015-16. In the first case only Rs 138 crore is left to be paid and if the second is used, Rs 1,600 crore is due.“We have said take it,” he said.“We have been waiting endlessly for a response from them to resolve the issue,” he added.', 'London/New Delhi: The British judge hearing the extradition case of liquor baron Vijay Mallya on Friday said that it was blindingly obvious that rules were being broken by Indian banks which sanctioned some of the loans to the erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines.Presiding over a hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, Judge Emma Arbuthnot described the case as a jigsaw puzzle with different pieces of massive evidence to be put together to paint a picture, which she said she was now able to see more clearly than a few months ago. There are clear signs that the banks seem to have gone against their own guidelines [in sanctioning some of the loans], she said, inviting the Indian authorities to explain the case against some of the bank officials involved because that relates to the conspiracy point against Mallya.The 62-year-old businessman, who is on trial for the UK court to rule if he can be extradited to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to around Rs 9,000 crore, watched the proceedings from the dock.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian government, laid out their arguments against the defence calling into question the admissibility of some of evidence submitted by the Indian authorities.Pointing out that Mallya had chosen not to give evidence in the case, CPS counsel Mark Summers rejected the defence claims on the evidence as nonsense.The government of India has established by other copious evidence a prima facie case of fraud, he said.The judge is expected to rule on the admissibility of evidence and set a timeframe for her final verdict. However, the matter could be delayed over further clarifications required on the source of some of the emails submitted as evidence by the Indian authorities.Mallya’s counsel, Clare Montgomery, argued that evidence that was claimed as a blueprint of dishonesty by the CPS was in fact privileged conversation between Mallya and his lawyer about legal advice in clear contemplation of litigation and hence should be inadmissible.On a separate category of evidence presented by the Indian government, Mallya’s team questioned the reliability of investigating officers in the case and pointed to over 150 pages of near identical material purporting to be statement of witnesses taken under Section 161 of the Indian CrPC.“They do not appear to be in any way an account of things that witnesses would have said but rather seem to be somebody else’s analysis put into the mouths of the witnesses, down to the spelling mistakes,” Montgomery said, adding that the documents were “identically reproduced” with not only the same words but also the same typing errors.The judge did not seem to be convinced by this argument and said she had found only two-three cases of mistakes but did not see a problem in the preparation of the statements.Judge Arbuthnot had also sought further clarifications related to availability of natural light and medical assistance at Barrack 12 of Mumbai Central Prison on Arthur Road, where Mallya is to be held if he is extradited from Britain.The CPS indicated to the judge that the government had provided all the necessary clarifications along with photographs of the two cells that comprise Barrack 12.The extradition trial, which opened at the London court on December 4, is aimed at laying out a prima facie case of fraud against the tycoon, who has been based in the UK since he left India in March 2016. It also seeks to prove that there are no “bars to extradition” and that Mallya is assured a fair trial in India over his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines’ alleged default of loans from a consortium of Indian banks.The CPS, representing the Indian government, has argued that the evidence they have presented confirms dishonesty on the part of the businessman and that there are no bars to him being extradited from the UK to face Indian courts.Mallya’s defence team has deposed a series of expert witnesses to claim he had no fraudulent intentions and that he is unlikely to get a fair trial in India.Mallya was arrested by Scotland Yard on an extradition warrant in April 2017 and has been out on bail on a bond worth 650,000 pounds. Chief Magistrate Arbuthnot is expected to pronounce her verdict in the case by May this year.If she rules in favour of the Indian government, the UK home secretary will have two months to sign Mallya’s extradition order. However, both sides will have the chance to appeal in higher courts in the UK against the chief magistrate’s verdict.', 'Chandigarh: The Lok Insaf Party on Friday announced to break its alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab in the wake of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s apology to a SAD leader for accusing him of being involved in the drug trade.Kejriwal tendered the apology to former minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Thursday for levelling charges of involvement in drugs trade against the former minister. “We have announced to break our alliance with the AAP. We cannot be associated with a party whose main leader meekly surrendered by tendering apology to former minister Bikram Singh Majithia,” LIP leader and MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains said in Chandigarh on Friday.Bains also called Kejriwal a “traitor”, alleging that he “betrayed” Punjabis by tendering an apology.“He is a fraudster. He accepted funds from Punjabis and also promised to punish Majithia. And now he tendered an apology which is a biggest fraud with Punjabis. Therefore we ended alliance with AAP,” he said.However, he said he will continue to support “at personal level” 14-15 AAP MLAs out of 20 who are working in the interest of Punjab.The AAP and the LIP had entered into an alliance six months before the Punjab Assembly polls held in February last year.In his apology, Kejriwal said he had now learnt that his allegations were unfounded.Earlier on Friday, Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann resigned as the AAP’s Punjab chief protesting the apology.Hours later, Aman Arora also tendered his resignation from the post of Punjab’s AAP co-president on Friday.Arora furnished his resignation to Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and AAP in-charge of Punjab Affairs Manish Sisodia and asked him to accept his resignation.The Delhi chief minister’s apology drew flak from his party’s other leaders and MLAs in Punjab, who said they were “stunned” by the move and “disappointed” as Kejriwal had not kept them in the “loop”.', 'Washington: Sex. Money laundering. Espionage. The investigation of Washington special prosecutor Robert Mueller is bursting its seams, going far beyond Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.After indicting 19 people so far, Mueller’s team has put on edge many people in President Donald Trump’s orbit, not least Trump himself. But the investigators appear to still have a long way to go before wrapping up their probe. Here are the various directions of Mueller’s investigation:Collusion: dirt on ClintonThe investigation’s main focus is possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Moscow allegedly offered the campaign compromising materials on Trump rival Hillary Clinton several times — some of which was published by WikiLeaks.According to reports and court filings, separate offers were made to campaign advisors George Papadopoulos and Carter Page.Another was allegedly made to top campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, in a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer.A key question: What did Trump know about that offer?Mueller is also reportedly eyeing Republican political consultant Roger Stone over his contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign.Back-channels to MoscowThere was a spider-web of contacts between campaign officials and Russians, but it is unclear what they add up to.Page, formerly a Moscow-based investment banker, visited Russia during the campaign, and was already the target of an FBI espionage investigation.Papadopoulos admitted to numerous contacts with Russians in England, as he sought to arrange a trip by Trump to Moscow.Kushner has admitted discussing a private communications channel with the Russians after the election, for unclear purposes. At that time Trump’s national security aide Michael Flynn was also having secretive conversations with Russia’s ambassador.Campaign chair Paul Manafort, according to The Washington Post, offered to share campaign information with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian tycoon with Kremlin links.The Post also reported that Mueller is probing a meeting that an associate of Trump, Erik Prince, held with a senior Russian in the Seychelles in January 2017 as another “back channel” effort.Russian hacking/disinformationSurprisingly, the Mueller probe has also dug deeply into the Russian meddling itself, and not only to fill out the picture of what happened in 2016. In February Mueller indicted 13 Russians linked to the Internet Research Agency for their efforts to manipulate US public opinion.That group included Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. Mueller is also expected to indict people involved in the hacking theft of Clinton materials.Follow the moneyMueller has already charged former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign deputy Rick Gates over laundering USD 75 million tied to work they did for pro-Moscow Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych.On Thursday The New York Times reported that Mueller has subpoenaed records from the billionaire president’s umbrella company, the Trump Organization, related to Russia and other matters under investigation.That could cut a broad swath: Russians figured large as customers in the business, with many buying condominiums in his New York and Florida projects.In 2013 Trump partnered with a Moscow developer with Putin links to hold his Miss Universe contest in Moscow.Trump’s 2008 sale of a Palm Beach mansion to Russian oligarch Dmitry Ryobolev for USD 95 million, which Trump paid only USD 41 million for, has also raised eyebrows.There are also questions about Kushner’s seeking international financing for a heavily indebted New York property owned by his family business, and how that may have intersected with the Trump campaign.SexMueller could also be looking into the possible existence of a lurid videotape in Russian hands involving Trump and prostitutes dating back to the Miss Universe.That was reported in the dossier on links between the campaign and Russia produced by British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Steele, much of whose report has proven to be accurate, was interviewed by Mueller’s team in 2017. Steele’s sources said the video could provide the Kremlin with leverage over Trump.ObstructionThe weightiest charge Mueller is exploring is Trump’s possible obstruction of his investigation.Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey, his constant comments on the investigation, possibly covering up the June 2016 Trump tower meeting, and other actions could support the charge. But Mueller will need powerful evidence to prove it, as it could set up a hearing on impeaching the president in Congress.', 'Islamabad: Hafiz Mohammed Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) on Friday submitted a petition against government suspension of their welfare activities in the Lahore High Court.JuD lawyer Advocate Dogar said Hafiz Saeed was founder of JuD and Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) and established 142 schools, and three universities. He added that Hafiz Saeed was engaged in public welfare activities for the last several years. The LHC has sent a notice to the federal and provincial government asking for a response from them within 15 days. Justice Aminuddin Khan heard this matter at the request of JuD chief Hafiz Saeed.  The petitioner stated that JuD had always been active in welfare activities and the US and India are creating a hindrance in the regular party affairs which is uncalled for. “It is unconstitutional to bar anyone from carrying out social welfare activities,” Counsel for the petitioner noted. He further said that the government must allow the party to let them conduct the welfare activities without creating any hurdles.The High Court on March 8 extended its order till April 4 under Justice Aminuddin Khan to take no action against JuD chief Hafiz Saeed. After his plea about possible arrest at the behest of the United States and India.The government lawyer pleaded the court to give more time to submit replies at which, Justice Khan gave another chance to the government lawyers to present their replies. Counsel for the petitioner, Advocate A. K Dogar contended that a delegation of the UN was going to arrive in Pakistan on Jan 26 and the government had planned to take strict action against Hafiz Saeed.The counsel said that the Punjab government had earlier detained the petitioner under Maintenance of Public Order for 90 days. However, a review board comprising judges of the High Court denied an application of the government for further detention and house arrest of Jud chief as it failed to justify the detention before the board.The lawyer stated that the actions taken against Hafiz Saeed by the government were based upon the pressure of the US and the Indian lobby, which had been propagating against him in the name of Mumbai attacks. He asked the court to stop the government from taking any illegal action against the JuD leader. The court would resume hearing on April 04.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry said Friday that the Indian government had yet to issue visas for Pakistani pilgrims awaiting to participate in the annual Urs (anniversary) of Ajmer Sharif which is scheduled to begin on March 19. According to officials of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, around 500 pilgrims were supposed to depart for India on March 18 to attend the days of the Urs at the shrine of Ajmer Sharif.The spokesperson said that there was a 1947 pact between religious and tourist relations between Pakistan and India, in which a special visa was issued to citizens of both countries to attend pilgrimage and celebrations of religious places. According to the agreement, India is bound to give 500 Pakistani visitors every year to participate in Khawaja Garib Nawaz’s Urs but the Indian High Commission had not issued visas in this regard. “Therefore, visitors have been advised to not travel to Lahore until the final announcement. With only two days left and the clock ticking, the visas have not been issued to the pilgrims yet,” he said.Officials said the Pakistani government was in contact with the Indian government in this regard, but so far has not received any positive response on the matter. The Indian government is not giving a clarity on the status of the pilgrims and the issuance of their visas. Every year, almost 500 people from across Pakistan visit India to participate in the Urs of Khawaja Ghareeb Nawaz.', 'Washington: The US cannot expect India to abruptly stop using Russian arms and instead needs a glide path to increase defence trade with New Delhi, a top American commander has told lawmakers.India is “a key partner and a great strategic opportunity” for the US, Admiral Harry Harris told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday. “Seventy per cent of their military hardware is Russian in origin. You can’t expect India to go cold turkey on that,” Harris told the lawmakers.“I think we ought to look at ways to have a glide path, so that we can continue to trade in arms within India,” he said.Harris was responding to a question from senator Tom Cotton who asked about the impact of the recent sanctions legislation (CAATSA) Congress passed, designed primarily with Russia in mind, and specifically countries that continue to use Russian military hardware and systems.India, a major consumer of Russian arms, is one of the countries that would be impacted by such a legislation.“I supported that legislation. I still do. But I do have some concerns about potential unintended consequences among countries that, for various historical reasons, still have Russian hardware and it’d be hard to avoid Russian hardware,” Senator Cotton said.Harris expressed hope to achieve some relief for the rigidity that’s in the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) legislation.Cotton then referred to a classified letter written by Defence Secretary Jim Mattis in which he is seeking exemptions for a number of countries. India is believed to be one of those countries for which Mattis has sought exemptions.“I assume Secretary Mattis’ point in this classified letter is, do you have a country like India that’s a close ally, and growing ever closer, but for historical reasons going back decades, they just rely on a lot of Russian equipment, and would really impair them and therefore, our relationship with them to try to ask them to go cold turkey immediately,” Cotton said.“You are correct,” Harris said.', 'NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE: Boeing Co, considered the frontrunner in the race to supply the Indian navy with new fighter jets, is now in contention for a much bigger $15 billion order after the government abruptly asked the air force to consider the twin-engine planes.Until recently, Lockheed Martin Corp’s F-16 and Saab AB’s Gripen were in a two-horse race supply at least 100 single-engine jets to build up the Indian Air Force’s fast-depleting combat fleet.Both had offered to build the planes in India in collaboration with local companies as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s drive to build a domestic industrial base and cut back on arms imports.But last month the government asked the air force to open up the competition to twin-engine aircraft and to evaluate Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, a defense ministry source said. That jet is a finalist for the Indian navy’s $8 billion to $9 billion contract for 57 fighters.The defense ministry plans to within weeks issue a request for information (RFI), the first stage of a procurement process, for a fighter to be built in India. The competition will be open to both single and twin-engine jets, the official said, but both Lockheed and Saab said they had not been informed about the new requirements.The latest change of heart is a major opportunity for Boeing, whose only foreign Super Hornet customer so far is the Royal Australian Air Force.It also illustrates how dysfunctional the weapons procurement process and arms industry are in the world’s second-most-populous country. The need for new fighters has been known for nearly 15 years, but after many announcements, twists and turns, the country’s air force has only three-quarters of the aircraft it needs.An indigenous light combat aircraft, the Tejas, is still not operational, 35 years after it was first proposed.  An Indian Air Force source said fighter procurement was urgent: the branch’s operational strength has fallen to just 33 squadrons, its weakest level in four decades, as it decommissions Soviet-era MiG-21s.“The IAF wants the RFI issued within weeks and get the process started,” said the source, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “The problem is that government keeps shifting what it wants.”A PRESSING NEEDOver the next decade, 13 more squadrons will be retired as their aircraft age out of service, parliament’s standing committee on defense said in a December report.The defense ministry declined to comment on the air force’s aircraft modernization program, saying it was not in a position to do so.Lockheed, which had offered to shift its F-16 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, to India, said it had not been told of any change to the Indian plan for single-engine fighters.“Our proposed F-16 partnership with India stands firm,” the company said in an email. Last year it picked Tata Advanced Systems as its local partner and said it was in talks with dozens of firms to build up the supplier network.“The Government of India has not yet issued formal requirements but we are continuing to support government-to-government discussions and engage with Indian companies about F-16 industrial opportunities,” Lockheed said.Sweden’s Saab was also caught off guard.“We have seen the reports in the Indian media, but no new formal communication has been made to us regarding the fighter program,” said Rob Hewson, Saab Asia Pacific’s head of communications.France’s Dassault Systemes SE’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also potential contenders under the new requirements, the air force source and industry analysts said.Admiral Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee last month that India was considering the stealthy F-35, among other options. But the Indian air force said no request had been made to Lockheed for even a briefing on the aircraft.An order the size of India’s is rare. The only comparable opportunity for the Super Hornet is Canada’s request for 88 fighters, which could be worth as much as $14.6 billion.The Indian air force competition has echoes of a 2007 tender for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft, for which Dassault was selected for exclusive negotiations. But the talks quickly bogged down over local production and prices, and in the end, the government ordered just 36 Rafales in 2016 for $8.7 billion.LOCAL FIGHTERThe air force ideally would like a combination of lighter single-engine and twin-engine jets, as well as stealthy aircraft, but cannot afford such a range of foreign systems, analysts said.A twin-engine foreign fighter would perhaps offer the best value while the Tejas finishes development, they said.India’s annual defense capital procurement budget of $14 billion to $15 billion has to be spread over the army, navy, air force and the indigenous defense research organization.  “The operational costs are going up with increased manpower, higher wages and general inflation. Ministry of Defence doesn’t have the luxury to go for too many platforms despite the rapidly falling squadron strength of the air force,” said Amber Dubey, partner and India head of aerospace and defense at global consultancy KPMG.Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said the company was ready to respond to any request from the air force.“We will follow the MoD’s lead on their process and will be responsive to their needs if we are asked to provide any information,” he said.Kumar said Boeing was committed to building the planes in India and had offered to help with India’s plans to develop its own advanced medium combat aircraft.But the experience with the Rafale contract has made experts skeptical that the latest tender will proceed as planned.Richard A. Bitzinger, visiting senior fellow at Singapore’s S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said he did not expect a resolution in even the next two to three years.“I am never surprised by what the Indians do when it comes to their procurement tenders. They are constantly changing the rules, changing their minds, and often even cancelling orders mid-way through,” he said.“The Indians have a remarkable knack for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.”', 'Hyderabad: BJP national president Amit Shah is likely to review the political situation in Andhra Pradesh after N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP’s exit from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and chalk out a strategy before the Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections here.According to reports, the BJP president is likely to hold a meeting with the core group of the party’s Andhra Pradesh unit later this evening.The meeting comes as the BJP finds itself in a tight corner in Andhra Pradesh after the TDP and YSR Congress moved notices for a no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha against the Narendra Modi government.The current political situation in Andhra Pradesh is of utmost concerns to the BJP since the state sends 25 members to the Lok Sabha and assembly elections are due to be held in 2019.The BJP has already asserted that the TDP’s decision to sever ties with it is a timely opportunity for it to grow in Andhra Pradesh.“TDP’s decision to quit was inevitable after its mischievous propaganda against Centre. People of Andhra Pradesh have now realised that the TDP is resorting to lies to cover up its inept and inert governance. Far from being a threat, TDP’s exit is a timely opportunity for the BJP to grow in Andhra Pradesh,” BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said.The TDP and the YSR Congress headed by Jagan Mohan Reddy are the two main parties in the state. While the former has been a part of the NDA since 2014, the YSR Congress too has often supported the government in Parliament on many legislations. However, both have now been targeting the BJP after the Centre declined to grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh.', 'Mumbai: With his charming appearance on small screen with ‘Kyun Hota Hai Pyaar’ and films like ‘Kai Po Che’, ‘Sultan’, actor Amit Sadh has created his own niche. The actor ventured into web with ‘Breathe’ alongside R Madhavan. In an exclusive chat with A media, Amit talks about his lull phase after ‘Kai Po Che’, his inner strengths, special connect with Salman Khan and much more. Excerpts:Was it a conscious effort to venture into web through ‘Breathe’? It’s a lie if an artist says that it is a conscious effort. A painter creates a painting similarly an actor doesn’t know. You do it with great intent and with your best imagination and then hope it works and connects with people. With Breathe, the whole team feels lucky and blessed that our hard work has created a story which people are connecting with.How was it shooting with Maddy (R. Madhavan)?When I met him on the sets, he gave me whole gyaan about the necessity of social media these days. He is a man of full of love. I am so proud that we are the lead runners of such a great story like Breathe. We do talk often on phone. He has been very encouraging and supportive. There is so much to learn from him.Amit SadhHow do you see your lull phase post ‘Kai Po Che’?Before ‘Kai Po Che’, I used to go for auditions in the hope that I will get work and should be able to pay my monthly house rent of 20,000 in 4 Bungalows, Andheri, Mumbai. Back then, I just had a small thinking that I would not borrow money from friends. I had no vision to become a star one day. I got a lot of praise and attention post ‘Kai Po Che’ but I was thrown into a big ocean suddenly. People used to give me guidance without even knowing me who I am. I kind of started slow. I am glad that lull phase happened to me initially. After a while, I went to shoot ‘Running Shaadi’ but it didn’t release for three years. I gained 25 kgs for a film called ‘Yaara’ which never released so far. In 2015, I did ‘Guddu Rangeela’ which didn’t work. In 2016, I started shooting ‘Sultan’. People used to call me a one film wonder. I am glad to understand the dynamics and demographics of functioning in this industry. A lot has been changed after ‘Sultan’. I did ‘Sarkar 3’ and then ‘Breathe’ happened.Amit Sadh turns up for the show.Was it difficult for you to position yourself as a brand in the industry?I come from a different school of thought. I know these things exits but never understood them. I know one thing that what in my hand are my craft, growth, indulgence, time and talent. I have started focussing more on that. I meet a lot of young and new actors and I want to slap them. They talk about so much about business and ratings. The big superstars should talk about business as they are the dynamics. I don’t care about any lobby and who’s doing what. I know one thing for a fact that the world is huge and your honesty and hard work will pay you off. I am die hard optimist. Who wants to be a superstar with one film? I love my growth. I am happy what Breathe is doing today. I feel the day you have a perception, you are dead!Were you intimidated by Salman Khan while shooting ‘Sultan’?All the credit goes to my director Ali. In fact, Salman sir helped me in few dialogues. When you become somebody, people tend to hold grudges and spoil your success. I am not that kind of a guy. When I will succeed, I will remember the good. Whenever I have introspected, I have been succeeded because of people. If you misunderstood me, I am not upset; there is a new day after that and so on.Amit Sadh So you aren’t willing to be a part of any race?The only race I am looking forward is ‘Race 3’ since I am a huge fan of Salman sir.What is your plan of action now?I have a big film ‘Gold’ coming up now. I have worked very hard on it. I have learned hockey for the film.', 'New Delhi: Reliance Digital is giving a 70 percent future buyback offer on the latest phone from the Samsung stable – Galaxy S9+ (256 GB) at their stores.Reliance Digital is also offering up to Rs 6000 cashback at its stores.

The new SUV is set to make its debut as a lightly veiled concept car at the Beijing motor show in April. It will then be revealed in production guise at the Los Angeles motor show in November.The new Mercedes-Maybach GLS will build on initiatives taken with the two-year-old Mercedes-Maybach S-class. It will share the same basic aluminium and steel bodyshell and advanced four-wheel-drive underpinnings as less-heavily specified versions of the new GLS.According to our sister publication, Autocar UK, sources state that the car – internally referred to as the Maybach 9 – will highlight its upmarket positioning by a series of subtle exterior design tweaks and a significantly more luxurious interior than standard versions of the US-built SUV. It will not only preview the look of the new model with elements aiming to provide it with added exclusivity, but will also highlight the sort of upmarket features – including autonomous driving functions – to be offered on the production version of the SUV.While speaking to our sister publication Autocar UK, a high-level official said, “We have been surprised by the sales success of the Mercedes-Maybach S-class, which is proving extremely popular in many key markets. The plan, now, is to extend the exclusivity surrounding the Maybach name into the upper end of the SUV segment. We’re confident this new model will leave little to be desired, in terms of luxury.”The basis for the new GLS is Mercedes-Benz’s MHA (Modular High Architecture) platform. This is a development of the existing MRA platform which is intended to underpin a series of new models – including the new GLE and GLE Coupé. It provides a significant reduction in kerb weight, the capability to support a 48V electrical architecture and the very latest in radar, camera and sensor-supported driving functions.The Maybach-badged GLS is likely to be offered exclusively with the Mercedes-AMG-developed M177 V8 petrol engine. This twin-turbo 4.0-litre V8 produces 468hp in the S 560, which was launched, recently. This presents the possibility of the new model being called GLS 560 for production. The new engine also features a cylinder-shutdown function for added fuel savings in city driving.Also being discussed for the new Mercedes-Maybach model is the plug-in petrol-electric drivetrain unveiled in the S 560e. It combines Mercedes’ new turbocharged and electronic supercharged 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine and develops 367hp with a 123hp electric motor. The proposed variant for the new GLS is claimed to use a lithium-ion battery for a pure-electric range of up to 50km.With the GLS produced exclusively at Mercedes’ Tuscaloosa plant in Alabama, the luxury SUV will be the first Maybach model to be produced in the US. As well as providing stiff competition to the Bentayga, the Maybach GLS has also been conceived as a rival to the likes of the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and Range Rover SVAutobiography.', 'Bengaluru: A woman has lodged a complaint against her former boyfriend, accusing him of blackmailing her with semi-nude photos she had sent him when they were in a relationship. The Bagalgunte police who have registered the complaint are searching for Arjun, the accused.According to the complainant, she and Arjun were colleagues at a company and fell in love.  Everything was fine initially, but later they had misunderstandings and started fighting over minor issues, which led her to calling off the relationship.

The actor has been diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumour. In a statement, he wrote, “The unexpected makes us grow, which is what the past few days have been about. Learning that I have been diagnosed with Neuroendocrine Tumour as of now has admittedly been difficult, but the love and strength of those around me and that I found within me has brought me to a place of hope. The journey of this is taking me out of the country, and I request everyone to continue sending their wishes.” He began his statement with an emotional quote by Margaret Mitchell — “Life is under no obligation to give us what we expect.” He also clarified that in the post that contrary to the rumours that were floating around, ‘NEURO’ is not always about the brain and that googling is not always the easiest way to research. “As for the rumours that were floated NEURO is not always about the brain and googling is the easiest way to do research To those who waited for my words, I hope to be back with more stories to tell,” he said in the tweet. pic.twitter.com/IDThvTr6yF— Irrfan (@irrfank) March 16, 2018Barely a few days ago, Irrfan had shared a cryptic Twitter post saying he is suffering from a ‘rare’ disease and that he will confirm about his situation in coming days. “Sometimes you wake up with a jolt with life-shaking you up.

He was aware of everything before marriage,” Jahan’s lawyer Zakir Hussain told ANI. He added, “The investigation will establish the truth.”Hussain further said that Jahan has given Shami the provision to accept his mistakes and solve the matter, but the cricketer denied to do so.“My client has given Shami the proposal to confess. But I don’t know why Shami is being so rigid,” he said.Shami’s wife had earlier alleged that his husband abuses her physically and mentally and was also involved in many extra-marital affairs.A case was registered against Shami on the basis of a written complaint filed by Jahan.In a recent development in the case, the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) has written to the BCCI’s ACU head to investigate the charges levelled against Shami by his wife.', 'Manchester: Jose Mourinho mounted an impassioned defence of his record at Manchester United on Friday after stinging criticism following his side’s miserable exit from the Champions League.After the struggles of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal following Alex Ferguson’s retirement in 2013, the Premier League club turned to the Portuguese in a bid to bring success back to Old Trafford. United won the Europa League and League Cup in his first season but the FA Cup is the only silverware realistically achievable this year after Tuesday’s surprise last-16 exit to Sevilla.Mourinho has been criticised by pundits and fans for his approach over both legs, prompting the United boss to go on a surprise, wide-ranging and lengthy 12-minute rant ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final against Brighton.The Portuguese used detailed notes to draw comparisons between his efforts and United’s performances in recent seasons, offering his critics a reality check about the club’s current status.“I say to the fans that they have the right to their opinions and reactions but there is something that I used to call football heritage,” said Mourinho, whose dramatic performance recalled Rafael Benitez’s famous “facts” press conference while Liverpool boss.“And what a manager inherits is something like the last time Manchester United won the Champions League — which didn’t happen a lot of times — was in 2008.”Mourinho pointed out that in seven seasons under four different managers, United’s best performance in the Champions League has been a quarter-final appearance and the club’s highest finish in the Premier League since Ferguson retired was fourth.“And if the fans, who I will always respect, always respect, if the fans are very disappointed, well the ones I speak with know what is football heritage, what is a process and when I arrive.” Football ‘heritage’Mourinho’s orchestrated response was a clear critique of the state of the squad and club he inherited when he took over just under two seasons ago, although his critics will point to the fact he has spent nearly 300 million on new players and only four of his eight major signings started against Sevilla in midweek.“In the last seven years, the worst position of Manchester City in the Premier League was fourth,” he said.“In the last seven years, Manchester City was champions twice and you can say three times. They were second twice. That’s heritage.“Do you know what is also heritage? It is that (Nicolas) Otamendi, Kevin De Bruyne, Fernandinho, (David) Silva, (Raheem) Sterling, (Sergio) Aguero, they are investments from the past, not from the last two years.“That’s football heritage and one day when I leave, the next Manchester United manager will find here (Romelu) Lukaku, (Nemanja) Matic, of course (David) De Gea from many years ago.”The depth of reaction to United’s defeat, and particularly the manner of their exit, even provoked suggestions that Mourinho may not be around to see out his contract.But Mourinho said the club’s owners and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, remain firmly behind him.“I have an amazing job to do,” he said. “I could be in another country with the league in the pocket. I am here and I am going to be here and no way am I going to change my mentality.”“I understand that for many, many, many years it was really, really hard for the people who don’t like me, here he is again, here he wins again,” added the United boss.“For 10 months I win nothing, the last title that I won was 10 months ago. I beat Liverpool, Chelsea, I lose against Sevilla and now this is their moment to be happy.“I learn that in my religious formation — be happy with others’ happiness, even if they are your enemies. I am a really lucky guy and happy to be where I am,” he concluded.', 'Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh PWD minister Rampal Singh’s daughter-in-law committed suicide in her parents’ home in Udayapura in Raisen district in the state early on Saturday morning.According to the police, Priti’s body was found hanging in her room in her parents’ home. A purported suicide note was also found with her. Although, her kin claimed that the move to arrange second marriage of her husband allegedly at the behest of the minister had driven her to end her life, the purported suicide note left by her however, made no mention of the reason of her taking the extreme step.  She also blamed no one in her suicide note for ending her life. The police was however tight-lipped on the incident. “We are probing into the matter”, additional superintendent of police of Raisen district Kiran Bala said.“She became very upset when she learnt that arrangement was being made to conduct second marriage of her husband. Her in-laws never accepted her as their daughter-in-law. Hence, she used to stay with her parents”, her brother said.', 'Colombo: A bitter, yet intense rivalry is expected to produce a cracker of a contest when a confident India take on a fiery Bangladesh in the final of the Nidahas Twenty20 tri-series on Sunday.While the second-string Indian team recorded a hat-trick of comfortable wins after their opening loss to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh reached the summit clash with a couple of dramatic wins over the hosts.The tense encounter on Friday night, in which they beat Sri Lanka with Mahmudullah rising to the occasion with a second last-ball six, will give the Tigers immense confidence.Be that as it may, Shakib Al Hasan was lucky to get away with a relatively small fine and one demerit point for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the match, and he will be especially charged up to prove a point or two. Unlike India’s rivalry with Pakistan and Australia, there isn’t any significant cricketing history attached to India-Bangladesh matches.But since their 2015 World Cup quarterfinal defeat in Melbourne where they felt a few umpiring decisions went against them, the tiny nation of cricket fanatics consider India to be their biggest on-field rivals.Bangladeshi players’ skills don’t match their zeal always but there will be no inches given when the likes of Shakib, Mushfiqur Rahim or Mahmudullah step onto the field.However, in terms of sheer talent, the Indian team is a cut above their Bangladeshi counterparts.Man to man, the opening pair of Rohit and Shikhar Dhawan have scored runs across the globe even though Tamim Iqbal and Liton Das are good on their day.Dhawan has scored close to 200 runs in the tournament while skipper Rohit is back in form after an 89 off 61 balls against the same opposition in the team’s last match.None from the 22 players has more experience than Suresh Raina in the shortest format and Soumya Sarkar a long way to go before he can be compared with the Indian left-hander.Dinesh Karthik and Mushfiqur Rahim are fairly on an equal footing as far as batting is concerned although the Tamil Nadu glovesman has shown composure more often in pressure cooker scenarios.Manish Pandey may not be as experienced as Mahmudullah in international cricket but Pandey’s 10 years of IPL cricket holds him in good stead.In the bowling department, Shardul Thakur has been steady and Washington Sundar’s Powerplay bowling has been India’s biggest gain from this tour.Vijay Shankar has also been impressive but unlucky at times because of the number of catches dropped off his bowling.However, the only worry for India will be second specialist seamer. Both Jaydev Unadkat and Mohammed Siraj have proved to be expensive. It will be interesting to see who plays on Sunday. Squads:India: Rohit Sharma (C), Shikhar Dhawan,, Suresh Raina, Dinesh Karthik, Manish Pandey, Jaydev Unadkat, Yuzvendra Chahal, Vijay Shankar, Shardul Thakur, Rishabh Pant, Washington Sundar, Lokesh Rahul, Axar Patel, Deepak Hooda and Mohammed SirajBangladesh: Shakib Al Hasan (C), Mushfiqur Rahim, Tamim Iqbal, Mahmudullah, Rubel Hossain, Sabbir Rahman, Soumya Sarkar, Nazmul Islam, Liton Das, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Mehidy Hasan, Imrul Kayes, Ariful Haque, Nurul Hasan, Abu Hider Rony and Abu Jayed.', 'Christian Eriksen proved Tottenham can thrive without Harry Kane as the Dane’s double sent them into the FA Cup semi-finals with a 3-0 win at Swansea on Saturday.With striker Kane sidelined for several weeks due to ankle ligament damage, Mauricio Pochettino`s side received an inspirational performance from Eriksen at the Liberty Stadium.The midfielder rose to the challenge with a majestic strike to open the scoring early in the first half of the quarter-final.After Erik Lamela increased Tottenham`s lead before half-time, Eriksen struck again after the interval to make it seven goals in 10 matches against Swansea.Tottenham, chasing their first silverware under Pochettino, are back in the Wembley semi-finals after losing to Chelsea at that stage of the competition last season.Pochettino was pleased with the way Tottenham took control without Kane and Dele Alli, who was only a late substitute.“If you watch the last three games, we won with a different starting eleven and now today too,” he said.“What is important is that everyone is available to play and the team is not affected by the names. We keep the same way, the same dynamic and that is so important.“It was a very good performance. We fully deserved the victory. Now, Wembley for the semi-final.”Swansea never got going on a freezing afternoon in south Wales and can now concentrate on trying to preserve their Premier League status.Swansea`s only chance to upset the form book came when they had an early appeal for a penalty turned down when Tottenham goalkeeper Michel Vorm upended Nathan Dyer.But Tottenham were unruffled and quickly settled into a tempo that had the home side outnumbered and second best in midfield.The visitors went ahead in the 11th minute through a wonderful strike by Eriksen, although Swansea manager Carlos Carvalhal appealed to the fourth official for VAR to overturn it.Carvalhal felt Martin Olsson had been fouled in the build-up, but there was no debate about the quality of Erikson`s finish as the Dane curled the ball past Kristoffer Nordfeldt from the edge of the box after being set up by Lamela.Tottenham forward Son Heung-Min crashed the ball into the net off the underside of the bar in the 23rd minute only for the goal to be ruled out for offside, correctly concluded the officials in charge of the VAR technology.Eriksen then found himself in space again on the edge of the box, but his curling shot was brilliantly tipped onto the bar by Nordfeldt.A second goal for Spurs felt inevitable and it arrived on the stroke of half-time.Once again, Swansea were chasing shadows and when Sissoko played in Lamela the Argentinian skipped past Tom Carroll and calmly passed the ball into the corner of the goal before Nordfeldt had time to move.Swansea made a change at the break, replacing Kyle Naughton with Luciano Narsingh, but the pattern remain unchanged as Spurs pressed for a third goal.Tammy Abraham might have pulled a goal back with a rare Swansea opportunity, but when Vorm parried a shot from Olsson, Abraham`s diving header flew straight back to the Spurs keeper.Nordfeldt then kept his team in the contest with a superb save to turn away Erik Dier`s goal-bound long range effort.Just past the hour, Spurs sealed the victory.The hard-working Lucas Moura played the ball back to Eriksen, who claimed a deserved second goal with a low shot from the edge of the box that had sufficient power to go through Nordfeldt`s hands.', 'New Delhi: It was a complete heartbreak for Indian fans after ace shuttler P V Sindhu lost her semi-final encounter against Japan’s Akane Yamaguchi at the prestigious All England Open Championships despite exhibiting top-class fitness under incredible testing conditions in Birmingham on Saturday.The world No.3 Indian shuttler played a superb match but eventually went down to world No.2 Akane 21-19, 19-21, 18-21 in an hour 19 minutes in the women’s singles semi-finals of the prestigious BWF World Tour Super 1000 tournament. This was Sindhu’s fourth loss to Akane in 10 meetings.Sindhu had clinched the first game 21-19 in just 20 minutes but lost the next two games 19-21, 18-21 to bow out of badminton’s most prestigious tournament.Sindhu was very aggressive in the first game but the Japanese fought back and won the battle of nerves in the second game.The Indian shuttler then upped the ante once again in the third game taking a 13-8 lead before Yamaguchi came back to level the game at 14-14.The see-saw battle continued in the third game as both players refused to give an inch to each other with the scoreline tied at 18-18.But Yamaguchi found her last ounce of strength and under immense pressure closed out the third game 21-18.The Hyderabadi was looking to be the first Indian since Saina Nehwal (in 2015) to play the final of what is claimed to be the world’s oldest badminton tournament. Saina had lost the final three years ago to Spain’s Carolina Marin in three games.Only two Indians have ever won the distinguished All England Open: Padukone in 1980 and Sindhu’s coach Gopichand in 2001, both victories coming in men’s singles.Akane will now take on defending champion, World No.1 and top seed Tai Tzu Ting in the final, who defeated Chinese eighth seed Chen Yufei 21-15, 20-22, 21-13 in an hour and four minutes earlier in the day.', 'New Delhi: Indian Air Force Flying Officer Bhawana Kanth became the second woman pilot to fly solo in a fighter aircraft after she flew in a MiG 21 Bison aircraft from Ambala Air Force Station at around 2 pm on Friday, reported news agency ANI.The “Bison” has virtually the highest landing and take-off speed in the world — 340 kmph.Bhawana Kanth, who hails from Darbhanga, Bihar, was born and brought up in Refinery Township, Begusarai. Her father is an engineer in IOCL and mother is a homemaker. She did her schooling from Barauni Refinery DAV Public School and completed BE (Medical Electronics) from BMS College of Engineering, Bengaluru.Kanth, in 2016, said that flying “like a free bird” had been a childhood dream, which inspired her to join the Indian Air Force.Getting the opportunity to opt for the fighter stream is the “best and biggest” thing that happened to her, she had said, adding that she wants to fight for the nation and make her parents proud.In February this year, Bhawana’s colleague Flying Officer Avani Chaturvedi made history by becoming the first Indian woman to fly a fighter aircraft solo — Russian made MiG-21 Bison. She took off from the Jamnagar Air base in Gujarat and successfully completed her mission.The fighter stream was opened for women in 2015 and Bhawana Kanth, along with two other women — Avani Chaturvedi and Mohana Singh were inducted into the Indian Air Force fighter squadron in 2016.Since then, the three women have undergone strenuous training programme to fly fighter jets.The Indian Air Force has already selected the next batch of three women trainee pilots for the fighter stream.Bhawna Kanth, Avani Chaturvedi, and Mohana Singh graduated from the Air Force Academy in Dundigul near Hyderabad, the premier training centre of the Indian Air Force, in December 2016. They had undergone their basic flying with Pilatus PC-7 aircraft at Dundigal before being sent to Hakimpet. Breaking the gender barrier, the Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat, too, had in 2017 announced that the process to offer combat roles to women was moving fast. The move will induct women on “an experimental basis” for five years initially.In October 2015 Centre took the decision to open the fighter stream for women too. Meanwhile, combat roles in the Army and the Navy still dont allow women, due to a combination of operational concerns and logistical constraints.It was only in 1992 that the armed forces began recruiting women to streams, other than the Medical stream. Countries like Britain, the United States, Israel, and Pakistan, have allowed women in the role of fighter pilots.', 'Beijing: Xi Jinping was on Sunday re-elected as president for a second five-year tenure by China’s rubber-stamp parliament, days after it scrapped the two-term rule for the presidency and allowed him to have a life-long tenure.The NPC has also elected 64-year-old Xi as the head of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high command of the two million strong Chinese military, the world’s largest. Xi has already been elected as general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) at its once-in-five-year congress in October last year. Significantly, Xi’s loyalist and close confidant Wang Qishan, 69, has been elected as vice-president, who like Xi is set for a lifelong tenure.Saturday’s election comes after the National People’s Congress (NPC) on March 11 ratified the constitutional amendment for removing the two-term limit for president and vice president proposed by the CPC.The election will ensure Xi heads the CPC, the military and the presidency, perhaps for life. He is the first Chinese leader to have that privilege after party founder chairman Mao Zedong who ruled China from 1949 till his death in 1976.Technically the election marks Xi’s second-term which would last till 2023. But after the constitutional amendments removed the term limit he is expected to have a limitless tenure. Xi was elected unanimously as president by 2,970 deputies of NPC which has the reputation of being a rubber-stamp parliament for ratifying CPC proposals.', 'Mumbai: The Shiv Sena is likely to remain neutral on the no-confidence motion moved by the YSR Congress against the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre. Though the Sena has been slammed the Modi government on many issues, it will however, remain with the National Democratic Alliance, Sena sources said. Sena MP Chandrakant Khaire has also said confirmed that  the party would adopt a neutral stand on the issue.After the Telugu Desam (TD) decided to quit the NDA, there was speculation about the Sena’s stand on support for the Modi government. If there is a vote on the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha, then the BJP will expect the Sena to vote in support of the government as it is a part of the government and the NDA, even  though it has only one minister, Anant Gite.Meanwhile, the Sena is monitoring the political developments. Sena MP Anil Desai said that party chief Uddhav Thackeray will take a final call on the issue. ', 'New Delhi: India has issued yet another note verbale to Pakistan after an incident on Saturday when Indian diplomats shopping in the “blue area” of Islamabad were followed “aggressively” by two men who hurled abuses at them.This was confirmed by Indian government sources who said there was another incident of harassment on Thursday when an Indian diplomat and his family — who were on their way to a restaurant in Islamabad — were aggressively followed by two men. Sources said that Saturday’s note verbale was the 12th note verbale issued by India on the harassment of Indian diplomats in Islamabad.India has asked Pakistani authorities to probe these latest incidents. There are also some reports from Pakistan that Pakistani High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood who was recalled by Islamabad for consultations recently may not return soon to India, thereby signalling a worsening of the diplomatic row. Pakistan is also alleging harassment of its diplomats in New Delhi. All this comes as the Pakistan High Commission is gearing up to celebrate the Pakistan national day on March 23.On Saturday evening, Indian government sources said, “Another note verbale was sent on Saturday by our High Commission in Islamabad to the ministry of foreign affairs of Pakistan protesting against the intimidation and harassment of Indian High Commission officials. This was the 12th Note Verbale this year on the subject.”Sources added, “Two incidents were highlighted: On March 17, Harassment of some of our officials who had gone for shopping to the Blue Area in Islamabad. Two people aggressively followed them and hurled abuses. On March 15, another officer and his family was aggressively followed by two men on motorbike when he was going to a restaurant. We have asked the Pakistan Government to investigate these incidents.”', 'New Delhi: A combative and emotional Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said that the Modi government was “arrogant”, “dramebaaz” and “drunk in power” and that the people of the country have realised that talks of curbing corruption and ensuring inclusive development was only a ruse to grab power.“The slogans of ‘sab ka saath, sab ka vikas’ and ‘na khaoonga, na khaane doonga’ are only and only dramebazi (drama) and a trick to grab power,” she said. “Under the leadership of former PM Manmohan Singh, the economy of this country flourished. Our government formed policies which lifted millions of people from poverty. And today, the Modi government is weakening these policies,” she said.Accusing the Modi government of using all means to stay in power, she said the Congress will never bow before the power of arrogance of this government which has launched vendetta against its opponents.She claimed that the BJP-RSS was trying to do away with the very identity of the Congress, but do not know how much the people of the country love them. “There is only one priority today and that is how to make Congress party stronger. The Congress is not just a party, but an idea several years ahead of its time,” she said.', \"Los Angeles: Singer-actor Jennifer Lopez has revealed that she was once asked by a director to remove her top during an audition in the beginning of her career.The actor said she flatly refused even though she was afraid of rejecting the director. “I haven’t been abused in the way some women have. But have I been told by a director to take off my shirt and show my b***s? Yes, I have. But did I do it? No, I did not,” she told Harper’s Bazaar magazine.“When I did speak up, I was terrified. I remember my heart beating out of my chest, thinking, ‘What did I do? This man is hiring me!’ It was one of my first movies. But in my mind, I knew the behaviour wasn’t right. It could have gone either way for me. But I think ultimately the Bronx in me was like, ‘Nah, we’re not having it.'”Lopez, 48, has spoken out in support of the Time’s Up movement and wore black in solidarity with them at the Golden Globes red carpet.\", 'Salman Khan has been putting his heart and soul into designing the perfect launch vehicle for his brother-in-law Aayush Sharma. And he hopes to leave no stone unturned for the cause. Now, we hear that Salman has even agreed to make a very special appearance in Loveratri, in order to boost Aayush’s prospects. A source, however, informs us that this wasn’t an overnight decision.  “Salman wasn’t sure if he would feature in Aayush’s debut movie,” says the source. “He didn’t want to take the attention away from the debutant. But then there’s a lot of pressure from the film trade.Everyone wants Salman in his brother-in-law’s debut, because Salman wants everyone to see his brother-in-law’s debut.” The special appearance now seems to be a special song and dance number, designed for Salman. ', 'Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman on Saturday said India has made rapid progress on the economic front but economic inequality in the country remains an issue. India has become a much “better place to do business” than it was earlier, though the bureaucratic obstacles have not gone away completely but reduced enormously.“India achieved as much economic progress in the (last) 30 years as the Great Britain did in 150 years. It is a very rapid space of transformation…why does there still seem to be visible poverty in India?“One problem is high degree of economic inequality,” Krugman said at a summit organised by a news channel, adding that India has made “enormous strides” in economic progress but the wealth has “not been evenly distributed”.On rising income of middle-class in emerging markets globally, he said: “People, when (they) mostly talk about the story, understandably focus on China, but India is part of the story as well. …India is still poor, but not in the same level at all. Indian GDP per capita is about 12 per cent of the US level now, which sounds low but that is up from 4 per cent not that long ago.Terming India`s economic growth progress as “extraordinary”, he said the country has become (on purchasing power) the world`s largest economy overtaking Japan and while being behind the US and China, it is far bigger than any European country.Attributing factors that played a role in the economic “progress”, Krugman said there was a dramatic change in India`s policy including liberalised policies taken in early 1990s.“I am on the Centre-Left, but I do not think the government should have a heavy hand on economy. India used to have License Raj, where bureaucratic obstacles were immense and that has not gone away completely but enormously reduced. India has become a much easier place to do business that it was. The PM said India moved from 148 to 100 in the rankings. That is not a badge of distinction, but it is better than it was,” he observed.According to Krugman, the transformation of policy came at a good time and the country opened up at the right time. The infrastructure is still a problem but it is better than before, he said.“India brought policies that opened up possibilities of doing business and made India attractive place for international companies to do business. There has been a real transformation of policies,” he said.The American economist, who won a Nobel Prize in 2008, was also optimistic about India for having first mover`s advantage in terms of globalisation of services.According to him, India`s growth story has been quite unique as the services-led growth have not been seen anywhere else in the world and the country can ride the next wave of globalisation on its demographic dividend.He, however, warned creation of employment and jobs is utmost important to sustain projected growth in demography and lack of manufacturing sector could work against it. He also touched upon the problem of corruption that the country has been facing.“There are issues of corruption. You cannot become Denmark with Chinese levels of corruption,” he added.', 'She’s known to speak her heart out, and is great with picking exciting roles on screen, but Radhika Apte believes that despite all her efforts, she did get typecast in the Hindi film industry. She says, “After Shor in the City, I was getting only roles of sari-clad characters. Nikkhil Advani (director) was the first person who came to me and said ‘I am going to cast you in that conventional glamorous part, because people think you can’t do that’.” Nikkhil roped in Radhika to play an elegant woman in Baazaar, which is set to release shortly.  But the sari-clad role wasn’t the only part she was getting typecast in. “People do have a very particular mindset. After I did Ahalya (short film) and Phobia, I was getting only thrillers,” she says. But Radhika, who is currently enjoying the success of Pad Man, says she doesn’t consciously refuse movies to fall out of the rut of being put in a mould.\\n“It’s not that I made choices that I don’t want to be typecast, so I wouldn’t do a role. Otherwise I wouldn’t do a Pad Man, in which I’m playing a sari-clad role again.

Although neither of the two have filed for divorce yet, the outlet says that it is not far away as there are no signs of reconciliation. Fans first noticed trouble brewing between the two when Jessica unfollowed Logic on Instagram.  But the case looks even more serious now, as sources say that the home they purchased together last year is about to go on sale.  The news comes as quite a shocker as just a month ago, they seemed to set major couple goals while attending the Grammy Awards, where Logic was nominated for Song of the Year for 1-800-273-8255.

He was indicted on two counts of money laundering, 10 counts of mail fraud, a report said.', 'We list out five things you need to know about the new Yamaha YZF-R15 V3.0.Styling and features\\nLike all other generations of the R15, this third-gen model is clearly at the receiving end of R1/R6-inspired bodywork. The new design has introduced sharp-looking twin-eye LED headlights with a faux air duct housed between them. The motorcycle also has a well-integrated bubble visor. For the first time, the R15 receives an all-digital instrument cluster which is horizontally laid out (with a white backlight as well as a shift-light in the same shade) and is informative but not overly-complicated. Overall, the R15 V3.0 looks stunning and has a design that will pull buyers in. Further R1 styling inspiration can be seen on the tank with similar ‘gills’ and in the tail-section, where it has similar aerodynamic scoops. The R15 finally looks proportionate and the pillion seat is also lower now, but it is still in a very sporty position.It is available in two two-tone colours – black on blue and gloss red on matte grey. Also new is a slip-and-assist clutch, making the R15 V3.0 the first 150cc motorcycle in India to offer this feature. As a result, you get a clutch lever that’s light in operation and a rear wheel that’s no longer interested in hopping under hard downshifting. The bike packs new levels of technology for a 150cc. However, the quality and finish on this bike is not as good as the previous generation models.Mechanicals\\nThe 155cc, liquid-cooled, SOHC, four-valve motor now has a 1mm larger bore, a new intake and exhaust system and also sports Variable Valve Actuation (VVA). The VVA system essentially employs a solenoid coil-based valve operation mechanism that utilises low-cam and high-cam intake rocker arms. This has an appreciable impact on its performance at either end of its rev range. The VVA also helps the engine feel meaty, even when it’s well past 8,000rpm. Not to mention that the motor now produces an impressive 19.3hp at 10,000rpm and 15Nm of torque at 6,500rpm while being paired to a six-speed gearbox.Accessories\\nYamaha offers a number of accessories for the YZF-R15, like a seat cover and a tank pad, as well as a skid plate to safeguard the exhaust while going over speed bumps. We particularly like the frame sliders that have been neatly integrated into the fairing. Yamaha also offers a USB connector for your phone. As part of the racing kit, you can choose a Metzeler tyre for the rear and surprisingly, Yamaha says it’s only for track use. Metzeler rubber, however, isn’t offered at the front and one has to make do with the MRF. The rear tyre is the Metzeler Sportec M5 140/70 R17. The Japanese two-wheeler giant also offers a Daytona muffler, which again, is for track use. Most accessories are well priced but the Metzeler tyre seems expensive and we’ve found the same size for nearly half the price on Amazon. Click here to check the pricing and get more details on these accessories. Track-focused\\nThe new R15 is more track-focused than the V2.0, in almost every way. To begin with, it has a more committed riding position – the handlebar is lower, the seat is 15mm taller (at 815mm) and the foot pegs are further back. The bike also has a sharper rake which results in an aggressive turn-in. Further enhancing its track capabilities is the fatter (than before) 41mm telescopic fork and a higher ground clearance of 170mm (10mm more that before). When we rode it at the track, we found it feeling more compact and immediate, despite having a higher kerb weight (139 kg; 3kg heavier than the V2.0). This is also a result of having a shorter wheelbase (1,325mm – 20mm lesser) and a decreased trail (88mm, as opposed to 98mm). The bike is now faster and a very good handler, but deserves better tyres. Yamaha has also equipped the V3.0 with a larger front disc at 282mm, but it continues to miss out on ABS.Competition check\\nEver since its debut in 2008, the R15 didn’t have any direct rivals; except for Honda’s CBR 150R, which has now been discontinued. At Rs 1.25 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) it is the only fully-faired track-focused 150cc bike in its segment. The only real competition it faces is from the non-ABS Bajaj Pulsar RS200, which is priced at Rs 1.24 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).', 'New Delhi: Neuroendocrine tumour — a rare disease that came into the spotlight with Bollywood star Irrfan Khan revealing on Friday that he has been diagnosed with it — is treatable if detected early, a city-based neurologist said.The disease, which according to doctors is a “quite rare disease and more common in males in the age group 30-50”, occurs in less than one per million cases. It is rare in both the general population as well as in patients with malignancies of tumour.According to Vinit Suri, Senior Consultant, Neurology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, “early detection can lead to cure by excising the tumour or giving appropriate therapy”.However, in Irrfan’s case, he has not yet revealed which stage of the condition he is suffering or whether it is malignant or not.Neuroendocrine tumour is a condition in which the neuroendocrine cells — that perform specific functions such as regulating air and blood flow through the lungs and controlling how quickly food moves through the gastrointestinal tract — develop into tumours.While a neuroendocrine tumour can grow in lungs or a small organ behind the breastbone called the thymus, or more rarely, in the pancreas, kidneys, ovaries, or testicles, “the most common is lung, pancreas and intestines”, Suri informed. Depending on the location of the tumour, the tumours may develop local symptoms. For example, if the tumour is in the lungs, patients may experience cough, bleeding in sputum, chest pain; if it grows in the intestines, patients may develop diarrheoa, bleeding and have black stools.“Because an endocrine tumour develops from cells that produce hormones, the tumour can also produce hormones. This can cause serious illness including palpitation, high or low BP, which may be precursors to various cardiovascular diseases,” Suri noted.The disease can also be genetically predisposed. Thus, for people with a family history, early screening is a must, the doctor suggested.Treatment depends on the type, that is whether it is benign or malignant and the location of the tumour. “Waiting for the disease to become symptomatic can make it incurable,” the neurologist said. ', 'New Delhi: Apple’s line of MacBook laptops is likely to show better year-over-year growth in unit sales than both the iPad and the iPhone, according to a new report from KGI. The analyst predicts Mac laptop unit shipments will rise between 13-16 percent in 2018, compared to about 7-10 percent for iPad and a maximum of 6 percent for iPhone.Obviously, in absolute unit sales, iPhone dwarfs everything else, but it is no longer the growth powerhouse. Wearables have been Apple’s best growth area in recent quarters, and KGI estimates that Mac sales will rise steadily this year compared to 2017.Unsurprisingly, most of the component shipments are allocated to the second half of the year.This is primarily due to Apple planning new MacBook models and revisions from June onwards. The supply chain will see component shipments increase almost 80 percent in the current quarter compared to the previous one as Apple starts ramping up for new product launches.With the MacBook growth story healthy, KGI says that the Touch Bar MacBook Pro models are seeing a larger weighting in particular. This is good news from a financial perspective because the Touch Bar laptops are also the most expensive MacBook models in the lineup.Ming-Chi Kuo reiterates his prediction of a new more-affordable MacBook Air in the pipeline for release this year. DigiTimes has previously said a new 13-inch Retina MacBook is on the way.The rumour mill is also expecting minor revisions to other notebooks in the MacBook lineup, although specifics are still yet to leak out.', 'Hyderabad: In a heart-wrenching incident, a debt-ridden goldsmith killed his family including a three-month- old infant.

Ramesh, inspector of Mahakali police station, said, “What we surmise is that the man must have poisoned his wife and children first and then committed suicide. The family has been staying in Hyderabad since the past seven years. Things will become clearer once the forensic report arrives.” He added, “One of the goldsmith’s customers had been calling him repeatedly and the victim was not responding to the calls. The customer went to the victim’s house and found the door locked from inside. He knocked at the door, but nobody responded. The customer came here and lodged a complaint.

The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 US elections.“It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” Democratic US Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted.“They say ‘trust us.’ Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,” she added, referring to Facebook’s CEO and a committee she sits on.Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation.Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers.“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.Pasquale said Facebook’s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users.“It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.Democratic US Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West”.“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015.Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015.The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. “We must do better and will,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that “our business depends on it at every level.”Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.Nuala O’Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington DC, said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. “That’s a long time,” she said.Britain’s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.“It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey’s office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are.', 'Malolos:\\xa0At least ten people lost their lives when a light aircraft crash-landed on a house in Plaridel, Bulacan of Philippines on Saturday.The Manila Times quoted Bulacan police provincial director Senior Superintendent Romeo Caramat Jr as saying that Captain Ruel Meloria, his passengers Elisha Necesario, Ma Vena Palunan, Romeo Huenda and Melvin Melgar perished, along with the occupants of the house have died in the crash.“The Piper PA-23 Apache six-seater twin-engine light aircraft with registry number RP-C299 crashed in the morning after takeoff from Plaridel Airport,” said The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).The CAAP said the cause of the crash has yet to be determined.

A no-confidence motion notice has to be supported by at least 50 MPs to be taken up in the House.The government has expressed confidence that the notices, even if they are admitted, will be defeated given its strength in the Lok Sabha.', 'New Delhi: The revenue department has started to analyse major gaps with a view to check any possible tax evasion, with only 16 percent of the summary sales returns under Goods and Services Tax (GST) matching with the final returns, reported Press Trust of India.According to the GST returns data, 34 percent of businesses paid Rs 34,400 crore less tax between July-December while filing an initial summary return (GSTR-3B).These 34 percent of the businesses have paid Rs 8.16 lakh crore to the exchequer by filing GSTR-3B, whereas analysis of their GSTR-1 data show that their tax liability should have been Rs 8.50 lakh crore.As per the analysis by the revenue department, initial returns filed and taxes paid by 16.36 percent of the businesses have matched with their final returns and tax liability. They paid a total tax of Rs 22,014 crore.However, the data also showed that there was excess tax payment of Rs 91,072 crore by 49.36 percent of businesses registered under GST between July-December. While they have paid Rs 6.50 lakh crore as GST, the GSTR-1 filed by them shows that their liability should have been Rs 5.59 lakh crore.The revenue department has analysed the GST returns data filed by over 51.96 lakh businesses during July-December, 2017. The indirect tax reform GST was rolled out from July 1, 2017.“While the differences in the liabilities reported in GSTR- 1 vis-a-vis that in GSTR-3B would need to be analysed in detail by the Government, one of the contributor to the difference could be non-consideration of credit/debit notes in the GSTR-1 data which would have been considered for GSTR-3B numbers,” said EY Partner Abhishek Jain.The GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising state counterparts, had on March 10 decided to further analyse data gaps between self-declared liability in GSTR-1 and the taxes actually paid while filing GSTR-3B.AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said, “84 percent of taxpayers reporting incorrect revenue statements, is a matter of concern. Triumph of GST depends on self-assessment mechanism for which we have to adopt completely bias-free, independent, automated, and digital Tax regime, which would be impossible if such high number of taxpayers are committing errors in data entry”.As per a Finance ministry reply to the Lok Sabha, GST mop up was Rs 93,590 crore in July, Rs 93,029 crore in August, Rs 95,132 crore in September and Rs 85,931 crore in October. The collections in November stood at Rs 83,716 crore, December (Rs 88,929 crore) and January (Rs 88,047 crore).

The drivers have made six demands that have to be met by the taxi aggregators for them to end the boycott.The protest by the Uber and Ola cabs in city from Monday, will not affect the city commuters because the cab drivers are just doing a symbolic protest by wearing a black badge, black cap or black shirt while performing their duties.Shaik Salauddin State President Telangana Four Wheeler Drivers’ Association, said, “We have raised several demands, including not providing incentives like before and providing valid reason for suspension of drivers. These taxi-hailing companies are giving first priority to company-owned cars rather than driver-owned vehicles, causing a slump in our business.”He further added, “We can’t ask all the drivers to completely boycott their work because it will affect their daily income. So we have decided to protest silently by wearing black badges so that customers are also aware of our problems.”', 'New Delhi: A true embodiment of determination and firm resolution, 56-year-old Mangala Mani is Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) first woman scientist to spent over 400 days, in the biting cold of Antarctica.The 56-year-old was the only woman in a 23-member team who went on an expedition to the Indian research station, Bharati, in Antarctica in November 2016. She successfully completed her mission last December, reported Times of India.Speaking to the English daily, Mani said, “The Antarctica mission was really a challenge. The climate there was very harsh. We were very careful while going out of our climate-controlled research station. One had to wear polar clothing. Even 2 or 3 hours out in the severe cold was too much and one had to come back immediately for a warm-up.”During the icy cold winter months, when the team was stationed at Bharati, she was the sole woman in the entire zone since even the Russian and the Chinese earth stations did not have any women present in the 2016-17 period, said the Times of India report.The selection process was not easy for Mani either. From medical tests to a psychological evaluation to temperature acclimatisation to physical endurance test, she had to go through it all.Talking to The Hindu, Mani said that it was a newspaper article on Mars by US space agency NASA that had inspired her to take up her chosen field.“A newspaper article on Mars by NASA fascinated me a lot and aroused an interest and a dream in me to join a space organisation like in Florida, which was on the coast,” Mani was quoted as saying by the daily.', 'New Delhi: Are you an Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) member and have also got registered yourself on the Universal Account Number (UAN) portal?

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was giving the 23 British diplomats one week to leave the country.The move, which was tougher than expected, followed Britain’s decision on Thursday to expel 23 Russian diplomats over the attack in the English city of Salisbury which left former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, critically ill in hospital.Moscow announced the measures on the eve of a presidential election which incumbent Vladimir Putin should comfortably win. Putin has cast his country as a fortress besieged by hostile Western powers with him as its defender, and state media is likely to portray the anti-British move in that context. The Foreign Ministry said Moscow’s measures were a response to what it called Britain’s “provocative actions and groundless accusations”. It warned London it stood ready to take further measures in the event of more “unfriendly steps”.Relations between London and Moscow have crashed to a post-Cold War low over the Salisbury attack, the first known offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since World War Two.The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador, Laurie Bristow, to a meeting on Saturday morning in central Moscow at its Stalin-era headquarters during which he was informed of the measures.Bristow told reporters afterwards that the crisis had arisen after “the attempted murder of two people using a chemical weapon developed in Russia”. Britain had only expelled the Russian diplomats after Moscow had failed to explain how the nerve toxin had got to Britain, he said.”We will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves,” the ambassador told reporters.WAR OF WORDSRussia’s response was more robust than expected. The closure of the British Council’s Moscow office will sever cultural ties, while that of the consulate-general in St Petersburg will end Britain’s diplomatic presence in Russia`s second city.Russian news agencies cited politicians in Russia’s upper house of parliament as welcoming the move to close the British Council, alleging it had been used as a cover by British spies.British lawmaker Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said the move to close the organisation’s office would hurt the Russian people.“It’s a great shame for the Russian people that they’re closing the British Council which has done an awful lot to educate Russian people in the English language and to help them get jobs and opportunities around the world,” he told the BBC. Amid calls from British politicians across the spectrum to take further action against Russia, the former British ambassador to Russia, Sir Roderic Lyne, told the BBC that Britain should avoid getting dragged into a prolonged showdown with Russia.“I don’t think it would be sensible to get dragged down into a mud wrestling battle with a gorilla,” Lyne said.Russia has complained that Britain has failed to provide any evidence of its involvement in the Salisbury attack and has said it is shocked and bemused by the allegations.Britain has escalated a war of words with Russia over the incident in recent days. On Friday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was overwhelmingly likely that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself had made the decision to use a military-grade nerve toxin to strike down Skripal.Britain, the United States, Germany, and France have jointly called on Russia to explain the attack, while U.S. President Donald Trump has said it looks as if the Russians were behind it.Russia has said is open to cooperation with Britain, but has refused Britain`s demands to explain how Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet military, was used against the Skripals.Skripal, a former colonel in the GRU who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence, and his daughter have been critically ill since March 4, when they were found unconscious on a bench.A British policeman was also poisoned when he went to help them and remains in a serious but stable condition.Russian investigators said on Friday they had opened a criminal investigation into the attempted murder of Yulia Skripal and offered to cooperate with British authorities.Russia offered some cooperation to British authorities after the 2006 London murder of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko too.Britain said the assistance, in that case, was not enough, and in 2016, a judge-led inquiry concluded that Putin had probably approved Litvinenko`s murder, something Moscow denies.', 'While there have been loads of rumours about Hrithik Roshan and his former wife Sussanne Khan getting back together for the sake of their children, the duo is maintaining a stoic silence on the issue.Elders in the families, and some well meaning friends have been advising the two to get back together again. Both of them love their children immensely and travel the extra mile to make their sons Hrehaan and Hridhaan happy.  In fact, even after their divorce, the two have taken vacations together, are frequently seen out for dinners and go for movie screenings too.\\nBut ask them to talk about it, and you’ll not find answers. While Hrithik completely clamped up about it, Sussanne let in more than a monosyllable when asked. “No personal questions,” she said with a smile.Well, the answer may be rather cryptic, but the smile seems to be a giveaway. We hope for the best for the family!', 'Colombo: India defeated Bangladesh by four wickets to lift the 2018 Nidahas Trophy on Sunday.Captain Rohit Sharma led from the front as he scored a match-winning 56. India were under pressure right from the start of the chase, especially after losing Shikhar Dhawan (10 runs) and Suresh Raina (0 runs).Manish Pandey (28 runs), too, played a very important role in the middle to help India chase the target.India lost a flurry of wickets in the middle-overs, but knocks by Dinesh Karthik (29 runs) and Manish Pandey ensured that they lifted yet another trophy.The match went down to the wire, with India needing 12 runs to win from the final over.India just managed three runs from the first three balls, but that was followed by a four by Vijay Shankar.However, in the following ball, Shankar departed for 17 runs and in came Washington Sundar.Meanwhile, The Men in Blue needed five runs from the final ball, and it was Dinesh Karthik who smashed an MS Dhoni-style six to take home the Men in Blue with another trophy.Bangladesh bounced back on to post a respectable total of 166-8 from 20 overs in the final of the Nidahas Trophy against India here on Sunday.Yuzvendra Chahal was the star of the Indian bowling attack, having picked up three wickets in his four-over spell.Earlier, Bangladesh, put to bat by India, got off to a promising start but lost Liton Das early.Since then, nothing seemed to work for them as they even lost their marquee batsman Musfiqur Rahim for nine runs.However, Sabbir Rahman, who put up a 29-run stand with captain Shakib Al Hasan (7 runs), came to the rescue as he played a knock of 77 to steer Bangladesh to safety.Apart from Chahal, Washington Sundar took one wicket whereas Jaydev Unadkat finished with two wickets.', 'Cape Town: Kagiso Rabada has been named in South Africa’s squad for the third Test against Australia – but two other fast bowlers have been added in case he loses his appeal against a ban.Rabada’s appeal against a ban for the last two Tests of the series will be heard by New Zealand judicial commissioner Michael Heron by teleconference on Monday, with a verdict due to be announced within 48 hours. Meanwhile, Duanne Olivier and Chris Morris have been included in a 17-man squad for the Test that starts at Newlands on Thursday.Rabada was man of the match in South Africa’s series-levelling six-wicket victory in the second Test in Port Elizabeth. But he made contact with Steve Smith after dismissing the Australian captain and was penalised three demerit points, which took him to the eight-point threshold which triggers an automatic two-match ban.If Rabada is absent, the selectors may be tempted to pick not just a direct replacement but to consider also adding a fast bowling all-rounder such as Morris to bolster the bowling options.Chief selector Linda Zondi said the squad would be pruned in time to allow players not selected for the Test team to play for their franchises in domestic matches starting on Thursday.Both teams took a break from cricket after the Port Elizabeth Test but will start their preparations for the third Test on Monday.South African squad: Faf du Plessis (captain), Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wkt), Theunis de Bruyn, AB de Villiers, Dean Elgar, Heinrich Klaasen (wkt), Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Duanne Olivier, Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada.', 'New Delhi: Contrary to popular belief that Mahendra Singh Dhoni was relegated from the elite category of central contracts, it was the former skipper himself who wanted an A+ grade for top performers, says CoA chief Vinod Rai.Twenty-six cricketers have been handed central contracts with skipper Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah being included in the Rs 7 crore A+ category. Dhoni is in the A category with Rs 5 crore annual retainership. “This A+ category was proposed by the players themselves. We had a discussion about this category with Dhoni and Virat. They proposed that there should be category of world class excellence in which players who play all three formats of the game should be there,” Rai told PTI in an exclusive interview.The head of the Committee of Administrators said both Dhoni and Kohli wanted A+ to be a functional category to indicate who are the Indian teams top performers.“This should be a functional category where players move in and out. Also it will show that the best in the business are rewarded as per performance.”What the former CAG found heartening was the camaraderie between Kohli and Dhoni.“Their camaraderie is exceptional with so much mutual respect. Virat respects Dhonis cricketing acumen and Dhoni respects what Virat is achieving as a player,” said Rai.In fact, Virat has told the CoA why he thinks Dhoni is irreplaceable in the limited overs set up as of now.“Virat feels that there are no faster pair of gloves than MS Dhoni today. Also Dhonis cricketing mind honed over so many years is an asset for Virat. As far as how many years of cricket is left in him, time and his performance will tell,” he said.Rai said that the best part about central contracts was that it ensured a decent earning for domestic players.“These increases have been proposed in consultation with the players. Domestic players, who were getting Rs 10-12 lakh per annum, will now get Rs 20-22 lakh per annum in addition to the earnings from Gross Revenue System (profits from TV broadcast).“Now with this kind of salary, domestic players can concentrate on their game without looking for jobs,” Rai said.There was a lot of anguish among BCCI office bearers at not being consulted and the finance committee being allegedly bypassed but Rai set the record straight.“We discussed with players and we placed the proposal to the office-bearers. The package was there with them from September (2017) and theres nothing new in it. Finance committee did not meet is a fact but package was known to them,” said Rai.“They did not even have any comments to make. Finally when we again met the players (during Sri Lanka series), we showed them and they did it was reasonable. So we decided to put it out as players have contracts and their insurances are in place before IPL,” he said.The retired bureaucrat feels that while everyone is happy to call themselves cricket administrators, very few know the practical problems the players have.“Nobody knows the plight of the cricketers than the cricketers themselves. They are interacting with cricketers everyday. In fact it was the cricketers who gave us names of former players who are facing difficulty in getting two meals together.”The CoA chief said no administrator should forget that they are there because of those 11 people who sweat it out on the cricket field.“The only thing we should never compromise is cricketers benefit. Whether it is the administrators or the media, we all sustain because 11 people play on the ground,” he concluded.', 'Kolkata: Close on the heels of the Modi government’s clearance to procure around 7.40 lakhs assault rifles of 7.62 mm calibre which will replace the 5.56 mm calibre INSAS for the Indian Army, the Army has raised serious questions on the quality of the weapon being developed by the Kolkata headquartered state defence manufacturer Ordnance Factory Board (OFB).Vowing not to compromise with the qualitative requirements (QR) for its weapons, the Army also pointed out that the assault rifle failed trials while deliberating that no one can meet its requirement in future. The Army’s concerns came after the OFB sounded its preparedness to start the assault rifles’ production which is likely at Rifle Factory Ishapore in North 24 Parganas with the defence ministry assuming that it would take around three years to place the first order for procurement.According to a Standing Committee on Defence report submitted to both the Houses of the parliament on March 13, defence production secretary Ajay Kumar told the parliamentary panel on the assault rifles, “Sir, I would like to tell that now in S.C. 7.6 mm best technology, 7.5 lakh assault rifles have been approved which will be made in the country. Whatever is the requirement of the Army, in that work of making about 7.5 lakh assault rifles will be done in the country. The OFB and Industries will build it together.”On the status and time frame for the assault rifles’ production he told the parliamentary panel, “In S.D.A.C. approval, it has been stated that the first order will be given in 2020-21.”Replying to the question of the assault rifles’ order and production OFB Chairman Sunil Kumar Chourasia, who is also the Director General Ordnance Factories, told the panel, “I am ready for production. (Assault rifle is being developed in-house by this R&D in Rifle Factory, Ishapore. PMT has formed in it, in which Army is the representative of user quality, all are working together on this).”The Army however explained why orders were yet to be placed even after the weapon was finalised. Its director general (Weapons & Equipment) Lieutenant General Sanjiv Verma told the panel, “Sir, this problem has been known for long years. The assault rifle or the carbine, which this Service is wanted, we have not been able to get. I just explain that. For the past few years, whatever trials have gone for the assault rifles and carbines, we were not satisfied with them. So, we have not been able to get the weapons….”Lt Gen Verma elaborated, “Recently, in the Defence Acquisition Council, a very deliberate decision at the highest level has been taken on how to proceed with the eight lakh plus rifles and carbines which we wanted. In that, we have gone for certain quantity for the fast track procedure from import. But for the balance, that is, seven lakh plus, out of that, the Ordnance Factory Board is also going to participate. But, yes, Sir, like what you are pointing out, nobody is in a position to meet our requirement tomorrow. Sir, it is not up to my requirement. How can I give order?”When the panel wanted to know about the QR and Ordnance Factories waiting for orders, Lt Gen Verma informed it that the Army has tried but the assault rifles failed in trials.He said, “Sir, QRs have been given to them. It was tried and tested a number of times. But, unfortunately, it did not meet our QR. Sir, your point is very valid. For a rifle, I cannot have a diluted QR to be used on the frontline. So, what we are doing is that we are importing a certain quantity and for the rest, the work is in progress. Various prototypes of weapons have come to us for trials and they are being tested. It is not that we have not tested them.”Describing the QR as ‘very stringent’, defence secretary Sanjay Mitra later assured the panel that the OFB would acquire technology to ‘make it up to the standards of Army’s satisfaction.’', 'New Delhi: Union Minister of Textiles and Information and Broadcasting Smriti Irani on Sunday lashed out at Congress president Rahul Gandhi for terming Goods and Services Tax (GST) the second highest in the world and one of the most complex taxes.Tweeting the link of an article, the Union minister asked the Congress chief to read it when he gets “free from the world’s longest coronation exercise”.

On this day in 1948, the state of Pakistan attacked and forcibly annexed the Baloch country to their newly forged colonial theocratic state of Pakistan.”“The Baloch nation has never yielded to any form of illegal occupation of their country. From the very day that Pakistan occupied Balochistan, the Baloch resistance to regain their independence began under the leadership of Agha Abdul Kareem Khan,” the statement added.The FBM further said the Baloch liberation movement has spread to all parts of Balochistan, to the old and young, men and women and all social groups.“Ever since the Baloch liberation movement has been transformed from a potential movement into a nationwide actual movement. It has spread to all parts of Balochistan, to the old and young, men and women and all social groups. Today, the illegal occupiers of Balochistan are totally aware of this fact. The decisive break is imminent,” the statement further read.The FBM highlighted that the colonial theocratic states are not here to stay forever.“The fact that they have never had a day free of instability, violence, corruption, religious fundamentalism, militarism, misery and extreme poverty during their entire existence is a case in point. Their entire existence has been marred by one crisis after another,” the FBM said.They further said the Pakistani rule has created killing fields in Balochistan, which shows that they are going through the last stage of their colonial rule in the province.“More than 6000 abducted Baloch have been killed under-custody by Pakistan forces. The victims include university professors, students, lawyers, poets, singers and human rights, doctors, farmers, workers, social activists and other highly educated members of Baloch society,” the FBM said in a statement.Later, the FBM confirmed that it will hold protest demonstrations in London, Germany, Canada, USA, the Netherlands, Sweden and Afghanistan on March 27, 2018, to mark the illegal occupation day of Balochistan by the artificial state of Pakistan.The Free Balochistan Movement has also invited all Baloch and other human rights activists to join the protests around the world and express their legitimate democratic right to be free from any form of colonialism and illegal occupation of Balochistan.', 'Port Louis: The president of Mauritius, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, resigned from the ceremonial position on Saturday, her lawyer said, amid accusations of financial impropriety that triggered a dispute between her and the prime minister.The president’s lawyer Yousuf Mohamed told local Radio Plus that she had decided to resign “to prevent a constitutional crisis”. “She doesn’t want the country … to suffer.

Last month’s disclosure of the fraud by PNB, India’s second-largest state-run lender has sent bank shares tumbling.The case, along with a flurry of smaller loan frauds since reported by other banks, has sparked new concerns that credit growth is unlikely to pick up quickly in an economy where state-run lenders that account for two-thirds of banking assets are already saddled with a mountain of bad debt.The Goldman warning is a blow for the government, which had hoped that a $32 billion, two-year, bank recapitalisation programme it unveiled last year would help Indian banks to begin to restart lending, spurring elusive job growth in the economy.State-run lenders account for the bulk of the close to $150 billion of soured debt in India. They have already seen the amounts they must set aside to cover bad debts grow due to new central bank rules, and are staring at further loan losses as they pursue a host of defaulters through the bankruptcy court.Goldman said it feared a regulatory crackdown after the huge PNB fraud, and the mountain of soured debt, could increase Indian banks’ provisioning burden and so slow credit growth.“Markets and investors are questioning whether the problem is more systemic,” Goldman analysts wrote in the note, referring to the PNB fraud, adding that markets feared the fraud would likely offset some of the positive effects of the bank recapitalisation and hit overall credit, investment and GDP growth.India regained its status as the world’s fastest growing major economy in the October-December quarter, as it grew 7.2 per cent, its fastest in five quarters.Goldman, which forecasts the Indian economy to grow 6.6 per cent in the current fiscal year which ends in March, said it retained its 2019/20 growth forecast at 8.3 per cent.Goldman said its analysts believe PNB was likely to take the hit of the entire $2 billion, wiping off more than a quarter of its net worth.It also said the average haircuts on impaired loans Indian banks would need to take could be 60-65 per cent over the next two years, higher than the 50 per cent it had assumed earlier, meaning overall provisions would rise.The still unravelling PNB fraud, the biggest in India’s banking history, has prompted the government to ask banks to scan all their bad loans above 500 million rupees ($7.7 million) for any sign of wrongdoing.Other small cases of fraud have come to light in the past month, while investigations into ongoing cases have picked up pace.Shares in another state-run lender, Canara Bank, tumbled as much as 5.4 per cent on Tuesday morning after the police filed charges against its former chief and others over allegations that the officials helped a company defraud the bank of about $10.5 million taken in loans over four years ago.', 'New Delhi: As pollution choked Delhi in recent years, a total of 140 air purifiers were purchased for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s offices and at least six other government agencies, according to previously unpublished government data.The purchases came as Modi faced criticism for not taking effective steps to improve air quality in Delhi, one of the world’s most polluted cities. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who belongs to an opposition party, called the city a “gas chamber” last year as levels of airborne PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that can reach deep into the lungs, far exceeded levels classified as “hazardous.”A British medical journal, The Lancet, has estimated air pollution was responsible for almost 10 percent of the total disease burden in India in 2016.Each year, when pollution levels shoot up in the winter months, the capital’s schools are often forced to shut. Last year, all schools in the city were closed for five days.A federal body that manages more than 45 government schools in the capital said it had made no purchases of air purifiers and had no plans to do so.“Offices are generally air conditioned, so air purifiers will function. Our schools aren’t air conditioned, windows are open, so air purifiers won’t make a difference,” said Santosh Kumar Mall, commissioner of the body, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.The World Health Organisation has recommended keeping windows closed when air pollution is high. It also says air conditioners should not be used if they draw air from the outside.Asked if any steps were taken to safeguard school students from Delhi’s dirty air, Mall told Reuters: “I don’t think so, when pollution increased a lot, our schools were shut”.The federal government, however, spent 3.6 million rupees, or about USD 55,000, to buy air purifiers for Modi’s offices and at least six federal departments between 2014 and 2017, according to government data reviewed by Reuters.Besides Modi’s offices inside parliament house, the agencies included federal economic planning think tank NITI Aayog and the ministries of health, agriculture, tourism, home affairs and foreign affairs.“This initiative is like giving gumboots to city officials when the drainage system collapses and the city is covered in muck,” said Oommen C Kurian, a health researcher at the New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation.“This is just not the response we are looking for.”A government spokesman directed questions on the subject to the federal environment ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment.Modi’s office and the six departments for which data was available did not respond to Reuters’ queries.Sales BoomAir purifiers are devices which use filters to reduce indoor air pollutants. Such machines are beyond the means of most people in India, where the annual per capita income was USD 1,709 in 2016, according to the World Bank.Still, air purifier sales have been surging in Delhi, a city of more than 20 million people. The sale of such units at Amazon.com Inc’s India website grew by more than 3.5 times in 2017 over the previous year, the company said.The home ministry spent about USD 20,000 in the last three years to buy 44 of the devices, while Modi’s parliament house offices accounted for 25 units which cost about USD 11,000, the data showed.NITI Aayog, which also spent about USD 11,000 on air purifiers, said the devices were “issued to officers at the level of joint secretary & equivalent and above, as per their requests”, according to a right to information response reviewed by Reuters.A senior government official familiar with Modi’s pollution-control planning said there was no federal policy allowing officials to buy air purifiers and such purchases were made only if departments received requests from bureaucrats.“Ideally, no one should need air purifiers and we’re trying our best to ensure that,” the official said, referring to the government’s attempts to improve air quality in Delhi.After years of criticism that Modi’s government was not doing enough, this year’s federal budget outlined a scheme for pollution control that will include spending USD 177 million on reducing crop residue burning – one of the main causes of pollution.Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan last month said pollution was “now linked to our national image.”', 'New Delhi: The CBI on Tuesday moved the Delhi High Court challenging a special court order acquitting former telecom minister A Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in the 2G spectrum allocation scam case.The matter was mentioned before a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Tushar Mehta. The court allowed it to be listed for hearing on Wednesday.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had on Monday moved the high court against acquittal of Raja, Kanimozhi and others in a money laundering case arising out of the 2G scam.The special court had on December 21 last year acquitted Raja, Kanimozhi and others in the cases registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the ED. Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, the special court had acquitted 17 others, including DMK supremo M Karunanidhi’s wife Dayalu Ammal, Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka of STPL, Asif Balwa and Rajiv Aggarwal of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd., film producer Karim Morani, P Amirtham and Director of Kalaignar TV Sharad Kumar in the ED case.The ED, in its charge sheet, had alleged that Rs 200 crore was paid by Swan Telecom (P) Ltd (STPL) promoters to DMK-run Kalaignar TV.On the same day, the trial court had acquitted Raja, Kanimozhi and 15 others, including former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura, Raja’s erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia, Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka, Unitech Ltd. MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) — Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the CBI’s 2G case.The CBI had alleged that there was a loss of Rs 30,984 crore to the exchequer in allocation of licences for 2G spectrum which were scrapped by the top court on February 2, 2012.Special Judge OP Saini had held that the prosecution had “miserably failed” to prove the charges.The special court, which was set up on March 14, 2011 for hearing 2G cases exclusively, had also acquitted Essar Group promoters Ravi Kant Ruia and Anshuman Ruia and six others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe.The first case, prosecuted by the CBI, had 17 accused, while the second matter, pursued by the ED, had 19 accused. The third one had eight accused including Essar promoters. In the CBI case, Raja, Kanimozhi and 15 others were tried under provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act dealing with offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, using as genuine fake documents, abusing official position, criminal misconduct by public servant and taking bribe.', \"New Delhi: Putting to rest speculations about the fate of 39 Indians who went missing in Iraq’s Mosul since 2014, External Affairs Minister (EAM) Sushma Swaraj on Tuesday declared them dead. ”Out of the 40, who were kidnapped, one person managed to escape, while others were confirmed dead after DNA samples of their relatives matched from the bodies exhumed from a mound, ” EAM Swaraj said in Rajya Sabha.Swaraj said that the dreaded terror outfit Islamic State (ISIS) had killed all of them.Speaking in the Upper House, Swaraj said, ”Mortal remains were sent to Baghdad. For verification of bodies, the DNA samples of their relatives were sent there and four state governments – Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar – were involved in this.””Yesterday, we got information that the DNA samples of 38 people have matched and DNA of the 39th person has matched 70 percent,” Sushma told lawmakers in the Rajya Sabha.Yesterday we got information that DNA samples of 38 people have matched and DNA of the 39th person has matched 70 per cent: EAM Sushma Swaraj in #RajyaSabha on 39 Indians kidnapped in Iraq's Mosul pic.twitter.com/almEfDANlz— ANI (@ANI) March 20, 2018I would like to confirm with a heavy heart that they have been killed by the Islamic State militia, she said.  The EAM further informed that Union Minister and former Army chief General VK Singh will now go to Iraq to bring back the mortal remains of the 39 Indians killed in Iraq.”The plane carrying mortal remains will first go to Amritsar, then to Patna and then to Kolkata, ” Swaraj informed.Swaraj had earlier refused to declare them dead without credible proof, saying this would be amount to “committing a sin”.“Declaring anyone dead without proof is a sin and I won’t commit a sin,” Swaraj had said in the Lok Sabha, responding to allegations that she was “misleading the house” on whether the Indians were alive.Sushma Swaraj had then asserted that it was the government’s duty to keep looking for the Indians, given that so far, “there are no bodies, no bloodstains, no list, no ISIS videos.”A group of Indian labourers, mostly from Punjab, Bihar and Himachal, was taken hostage by ISIS when it overran Iraq’s second largest city Mosul in 2014.The workers were trying to leave Mosul when they were intercepted and taken hostage by the ISIS fighters.One of the captured Indians, Harjit Masih from Gurdaspur, had managed to escape and claimed to have witnessed the massacre of the others.The Government of India (GoI) rejected his claim and maintained that all efforts were on to find the missing Indians and, without any credible information, the workers would be considered alive.The GoI had even asked Iraq for help in locating the missing Indians after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul from ISIS.The government in Iraq too had earlier expressed its inability to confirm if Indians taken hostage by the ISIS in Mosul three years ago were alive or dead.   \", 'BENGALURU: Expelled and jailed AIADMK chief VK Sasikala on Tuesday walked out of Bengaluru jail after being granted a 15-day parole to attend the last rites of her husband M Natarajan, who died in the wee hours of Tuesday following multiple organ failures.Earlier today, Sasikala applied for parole following her husband’s demise in the wee hours of Tuesday. Last week, the 75-year-old was rushed to Gleneagles Global Health City hospital for chest infection.Sasikala, who is currently lodged in Bengaluru’s Parappanna Agrahara Jail, is set to travel to Thanjavur directly by road for the funeral.In January, Natarajan had surrendered before a CBI court here in connection with a case involving evasion of duty on the import of a luxury car from Britain.The Madras High Court had in November last year upheld a trial court order sentencing Natarajan and three others in the case registered 23 years ago.In December, the Supreme Court granted bail to Natarajan and asked him to deposit Rs 25 lakh each in its registry. He didn`t appear in the past hearings citing poor health.Shanmuga Priyan, Chief Operation Officer, Gleneagles Global Health City, Chennai, released a statement, stating that every possible attempt was made to sustain his revival. However, despite their best efforts, he was unable to recover.Natarajan had also undergone a liver and kidney transplant in 2017.Sasikala is currently serving a four-year imprisonment and is lodged in central prison in Bengaluru in a disproportionate assets case. She was sent to Parappana Agrahara central prison in February last year.', 'New Delhi: Eating disorders in men are five times more likely to remain underdiagnosed as compared to women, which also delays their treatment options, a study has revealed.Eating disorders include conditions like anorexia nervosa, bulimia, binge eating disorder and overconsumption and are characterized by irregular eating habits and severe distress or concern about body weight or shape.“Stereotypes about who develops eating disorders could contribute to disparities in diagnosis and treatment, with males of higher weight, people of colour, and the non-affluent most likely to be slipping through the cracks,” said Kendrin Sonneville, Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan in the US.The study which was conducted on 1,700 college graduates found that females were almost 1.5 times more likely to get treated than males, and affluent students were nearly two times more likely to get treatment compared to non-affluent.White students were nearly two times more likely to get diagnosed than students of colour, and underweight students were more than six times more likely to get diagnosed than those with a healthy body weight.Students with overweight or obesity were about half as likely to get diagnosed.“Most people with an eating disorder never get diagnosed and never get treatment, even though successful treatments that can reduce suffering, health consequences and cost are available,” Sonneville said.“Many individuals with eating disorders do not recognize themselves in these stereotyped portrayals of eating disorders in the media and may not recognize the need for treatment,” Sonneville added.The results showed that anorexia was much more likely to get diagnosed (73 percent) compared to individuals with binge eating disorder (seven percent).Sonneville said universal screening and prevention, led by clinicians, could help reduce these disparities.The study was published in the journal International Journal of Eating Disorders.', 'The third-generation BMW 1-series is set to be a turning point for the German carmaker and its launch signifies the company’s front-wheel drive push into high gear in 2019.However, the flagship M130iX M Performance model will be four-wheel drive. The M130iX hot hatch will be a crucial part of the overhaul to front-wheel drive as BMW tries to prove that it can offer a credible front-driven performance model alongside its traditionally successful rear-wheel-drive M cars.Currently in the early stages of development, the BMW M division’s future competitor to the Volkswagen Golf R, Audi S3 and upcoming Mercedes-AMG A35 is scheduled for launch in 2020. It will feature specially tuned version of BMW’s turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, developing around 304hp, together with a multi-plate-clutch xDrive four-wheel-drive system.BMW controversially halted a long tradition of rear-drive and four-wheel-drive models with the introduction of the 2-series Active Tourer in 2014 and the subsequent launch of the larger 2-series Gran Tourer in 2015. The carmaker now plans to bolster its front-wheel-drive line-up with the new 1-series, which forgoes the longitudinal engine mounting of today’s second-generation model for a space-saving transversely mounted engine.The move is set to provide the new 1-series with a lower kerb weight and improved packaging, together with simplified production processes and greater profitability than its rear-wheel-drive predecessor.The new rival to the Audi A3 is the first model to be based on BMW’s front-wheel-drive FAAR (Frontantriebsarchitektur) platform. According to BMW’s head of development, Klaus Fröhlich, this structure is a progression of the UKL platform that underpins the 2-series Active Tourer and 2-series Gran Tourer, as well as the existing Mini line-up, but with added modularity and the flexibility to support full-electric drivetrain and battery combinations.Despite the switch to BMW’s latest front-wheel-drive platform, the exterior styling of the new 1-series is set to retain the cab-back influences that have distinguished it from rivals since its addition to the BMW line-up in 2004.The new 1-series hatchback will be powered by updated versions of today’s turbocharged 1.5-litre three-cylinder and turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engines. The more powerful versions are planned to adopt a particulate filter in an attempt to reduce CO2 emissions to a model-line-specific average of less than 120g/km, according to BMW engineering sources.BMW has future-proofed the new 1-series by providing it with at least one mild-hybrid drivetrain in the form of a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine fitted with an integrated starter motor and 48V electric system. BMW is also readying a petrol-electric plug-in hybrid variant of its new entry-level hatchback.', 'Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt make for a fabulous on-screen pair, and have delivered only hits when they’ve come together. Now, they’ll be seen together again on April 13, when the movie October releases. Well, Alia isn’t acting in October, but the theatrical trailer of her upcoming flick Raazi, produced by Junglee pictures and Karan Johar, is being attached to the Varun Dhawan-starrer. October is being bankrolled by Ronnie Lahiri and directed by Shoojit Sircar. “Alia and Varun are very good friends, so are Shoojit and Karan. Raazi hits the screens a month later, and so Karan requested that the trailer of his movie be attached to October. And Shoojit was raazi too!” says a source. The gorgeous pair of Alia and Varun are then going to be seen together, even if it’s not for the same movie. ', 'John Abraham has a weakness for all things fast, and must be rather pleased that the shooting for his movie, tentatively titled Satyamev Jayate, is going ahead at a breakneck speed. Being shot around various locations in Mumbai, the movie also stars Manoj Bajpayee, who is running after John to arrest him in the movie. Our sources from the set inform us, “John has been working on all his own stunts, around locations like Aarey Colony and Madh Island. There’s also a rather interesting bike scene that was canned and it was simply awesome. John looked dashing and completed the shot with all his strength. The action sequences are great.”  While even most people on the set are unaware of the plot completely, they’ve been intrigued by what’s been going on so far. “There’s not been a single emotional or romantic scene shot yet. We don’t even know who the actress cast opposite John is. The action scenes seem to be on top of the priority list for the director in this schedule, which has just been wrapped up.”The movie is being touted as a suspense thriller, and a scene shot recently sees John take on policemen after a fight, killing many of them in the process. About Manoj, the source tells us, “Manoj is playing an important officer, who is chasing John but hasn’t been able to arrest him yet.”Lastly, while the shooting’s a hush-hush affair, our sources believe that the name of the movie might be changed by the time it hits theatres. “It’s possible that Satyamev Jayate is a working title, but for now we’ve gotten used to that name,” the source adds.', 'The actress, who claims to be a nationalist and someone who’s always been unlucky in love, reveals why no political party will be interested in hiring herOn Saturday, at the Rising India Summit, Kangana Ranaut decided to pick up the microphone herself and start talking even before the anchor could kick-start the session. During her session, professing her love for the PM, the actress said: “I am a big Modi fan. Unfortunately, I am not politically aware. For a success story and as a young woman, I believe that we need to have the right role models. We have a prime minister who is a chaiwala. It is not his victory, it is a victory of democracy. I feel he is the right role model.” Calling herself a nationalist who doesn’t believe in any religion, she stated, “I had never heard the word nationalism before. The good news is that someone is using this word now! I, as a youth, want to see growth in my life. If India does not grow, I don’t grow.”Talking about being let down in the Hrithik Roshan affair, the actress said, “At every point you feel that you will be let down and you will never love again. I have been feeling like that since I was 16. I have had so many affairs; I’ve always felt that life has taken everything away from me and that I cannot fall in love again. Even after this thing (the Hrithik affair) fell apart, another man came into my life and I felt I couldn’t handle it anymore. But everything changed in two to three months and I felt that I was ready, and how!”Kangana said that for her, love was not just about having a physical experience, and added, “But just when you feel you are so high in love, that person says, ‘Oh, you are psycho!’ and that person also left. You burst into tears every time you kiss and you are called a psycho.”The actress also spoke her mind on Indian politics. “What I don’t like about politicians is their dress sense. I will not wear those clothes if I get into politics and I don’t think they are going to be okay with that. And the way I speak, I don’t think any party will be interested in hiring me,” she said.Tweet talkHere’s what Twitteratis have to say about Kangana’s  speech\\nNirmala Sitharaman @nsitharaman: “Above everything, we are Indian.” Well said Kangana!

A lawyer for Sarkozy could not be reached immediately for comment.France opened a judicial inquiry in 2013 into allegations that Sarkozy’s successful 2007 election bid benefited from illicit funds from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. A former minister and close ally of Sarkozy, Brice Hortefeux, was also being questioned by police on Tuesday morning in relation to the Libya investigation, another source close to the probe said.Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has always denied receiving any illicit campaign funding and has dismissed the Libyan allegations as “grotesque”.In January a French businessman suspected by investigators of funneling money from Gaddafi to finance Sarkozy’s campaign was arrested in Britain and granted bail after he appeared in a London court.Sarkozy has already been ordered to stand trial in a separate matter concerning financing of his failed re-election campaign in 2012, when he was defeated by Francois Hollande.', 'London: Britain’s information commissioner says she is using all her legal powers to investigate the handling of millions of people’s personal Facebook data by the social media giant and by political campaign consultants Cambridge Analytica.Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s servers. The company allegedly used data mined from Facebook to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. She told BBC on Tuesday she is also investigating Facebook and has asked the company not to pursue its own audit of Cambridge Analytica’s data use. She says Facebook has agreed.“Our advice to Facebook is to back away and let us go in and do our work,” she said.Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires platforms like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.Chris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.Denham launched her investigation after weekend reports that Cambridge Analytica improperly used information from more than 50 million Facebook accounts. Facebook has suspended the company from the social network.The data harvesting has also triggered calls for further investigation from the European Union, as well as federal and state officials in the United States.', 'Baghdad: Iraqi authorities have discovered a mass grave with the bodies of 38 Indian construction workers abducted when Islamic State militants overran the northern city of Mosul in 2014, officials said Tuesday.The bodies were found buried near the village of Badush, northwest of Mosul, in an area that Iraqi forces recaptured last July. The killing was a “heinous crime carried out by Daesh terrorist gangs,” Iraqi official Najiha Abdul-Amir al-Shimari told reporters. Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.The people killed were “citizens of the friendly Indian state. Their dignity was supposed to be protected, but the forces of evil wanted to defame the principles of Islam,” said Najiha, the head of Iraq’s Martyrs Establishment, a government body dealing with people killed in the fight against the Islamic State group.The abducted workers, most from northern India, had been employed by a construction company operating near Mosul when militants captured wide swaths of northern Iraq in the summer of 2014.Relatives said they received panicked phone calls from some of the workers five days after Mosul was captured, asking for help.Around 10,000 Indians worked and lived in Iraq at that time.Dozens of mass graves have been discovered in the territory once held by the Islamic State group, though Iraq’s government has only been able to examine a handful of them. Iraqi officials say they lack the resources and trained personnel to properly exhume so many sites.At the height of their power, IS controlled nearly a third of the country.After Iraq recaptured the area around Mosul, search operations led to a mound of dirt near Badush, where local residents said bodies had been buried by the IS, Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said in Parliament.Iraqi authorities used radar to verify that the mound was a mass grave, she said, and then exhumed the bodies. Indian authorities then sent DNA samples from relatives of the missing workers.Forty Indians were captured by the militants, though one man managed to escape. Iraqi authorities said the mass grave held 39 bodies, but only 38 have been positively identified through DNA analysis. Analysis on the last body has not yet been completed, Swaraj said.“It is indeed a moment of deep grief and sadness for us,” India’s ambassador to Iraq, Pradeep Singh Rajpurohit, told reporters in Baghdad. “India strongly condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations and stands in solidarity with the government and the people of Iraq in their fight against terrorism.”He said the bodies will be sent back to India “in a couple of weeks or so.”Harjit Masih, the only Indian survivor, has long said that the rest of the group had been killed. He said they had all been held for a number of days, then taken outside and ordered to kneel. Then the militants opened fire.“They were killed in front of my eyes,” he told reporters Tuesday in his north Indian home village. He was shot in the thigh but managed to escape.Iraq, which is in the midst of an economic crisis, is also struggling to remove rebuild after more than three years of gruelling war against the militants. The fight against IS has cost Iraq more than USD 1 billion in destroyed infrastructure, officials say.', 'Beirut: A monitor said Tuesday three dozen pro-government fighters were killed in a district of Syria’s capital as Islamic State jihadists took control of it in a surprise night time attack.There was no immediate comment from the government on the report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which could not provide casualty figures for the jihadists. “IS took full control of Qadam, and 36 government troops and loyalist fighters have been killed,” the Britain-based monitoring group said.Dozens more were wounded or captured, or are still missing in action, Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said.IS launched the attack from positions it holds in the adjacent Hajar al-Aswad district, Abdel Rahman said.“Regime forces are bringing reinforcements to the area around Qadam to try to retake it,” he said.Qadam lies in a southern part of Damascus and has for several years hosted a range of Islamist rebels and extremists, including IS and its arch-enemy, Al-Qaeda’s onetime Syrian branch Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).The Syrian government has used both military pressure and negotiated settlements to try to clear the area.Last week, hundreds of HTS fighters evacuated the district under a deal with Damascus that granted them and their family members safe passage, with most heading northwest to Idlib province.IS jihadists have even agreed to evacuate the district in the past.The jihadist group put out a statement late Monday saying it had captured most of Qadam, including areas “surrendered” to regime forces by HTS.The district is smaller than and not connected to Eastern Ghouta, an area east of the capital which is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians and rebels.Syrian troops are waging a separate offensive there.', 'Lucknow: Ahead of Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s announcement of his new team, resignations have begun in the party with actor-politician Raj Babbar now quitting as party’s Uttar Pradesh Congress chief. A source close to the party was quoted as saying that Babbar has been asked to continue on his post till a new state unit chief is elected by the party.Gujarat Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki is also believed to have tendered his resignation to the central leadership of the party.  This comes days after Rahul Gandhi was authorised to nominate the Congress Working Committee (CWC).If sources are to be believed several top leaders of the party may quit in the days to come.   The 2000-odd All India Congress Committee (AICC) delegates had on Sunday raised their hands to unanimously authorise Gandhi to reconstitute the CWC, putting an end to speculation that the new chief will take the election route to form the party’s highest decision-making body.As per the Congress Constitution, 12 of the 25 CWC members have to be elected by AICC delegates and the rest are appointed by the Congress president.The CWC has not witnessed any election in more than two decades now. The last time the CWC witnessed a contest was in 1997 during the Kolkata plenary and prior to that in 1992 at the Tirupati session.Nervousness among veterans over the possible generational shift and the proposed reforms in the organisational structure had been getting increasingly palpable since Gandhi was anointed as party vice-president in January 2013.Raj Babbar’s resignation points to this nervousness in the old guard of the party after Rahul formally took over as Congress chief.Babbar’s resignation is also being linked to party’s worst performance in recent Lok Sabha bypolls to Gorakhpur and Phulpur.The two seats hold importance in state politics and the bypolls there were necessitated after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath resigned from his Gorakhpur seat to form BJP government in the state, and Phulpur representative Keshav Prasad Maurya stepped down to take the post of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister.Earlier on Monday, Goa Congress president Shantaram Naik too resigned from his post.Goa Congress president Shantaram Naik resigned from his post, saying he was “inspired” by Rahul Gandhi’s speech at the party plenary about making way for younger leaders.Naik, 71, is the first senior Congress leader to resign after Rahul Gandhi announced on Sunday in his concluding speech that he wants to give the younger generation a chance to come forward and lead the party.Naik sent his resignation to the All India Congress Committee, ending his stint as Goa Pradesh congress committee president since July 8, 2017, when he had replaced senior party leader Luizinho Faleiro.“I have resigned from the post of Goa Congress chief to pave the way for the younger generation to come forward.“I was inspired by party chief Rahul Gandhi’s speech at the plenary session, where he said he wanted to give chance to the younger generation,” he told PTI.During the session, the entire stage was empty and only those who were delivering speech used to go up and do it from the podium, he said.“Everyone including Sonia Gandhi was off the dais,” Naik said.“When Rahul Gandhi went to deliver the speech, he said the stage is kept empty so as to let the younger generation take over the reins. My resignation is to make way for the young leadership to take over,” the former MP said.Naik was elected to Lok Sabha in 1984 from North Goa constituency and twice to Rajya Sabha later. Congress, with 16 legislators, is currently the main Opposition in the Goa Legislative Assembly.Naik said he was turning 72 and wanted the young to now lead the party.(With Agency inputs)', 'Hyderabad: Has Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu, who once who played a key role in national politics, lost ground over the last few months? The idea of the federal front was floated not by him but by Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. In the case of the no-confidence motion sought to be moved by his party against the BJP government at the Centre, it was the Congress and other parties that have taken advantage.His decision to end his party’s ties with the BJP after a four-year long allian-ce has also not gone down well with some parties that are close to the TD.Moreover, he has himself repeatedly declared that he is not interested in national politics and will confine himself to his state and its development.This is a far cry from the days when Mr Naidu played a key role in national politics as the convenor of the United Front. To form the government at the centre, the United Front took the support of the Congress party, arch rival of the TD.In AP too, all political parties criticise Mr Naidu for not being a reliable friend. Nationally also, the perception of Mr Naidu being unreliable gaining ground. According to Mr Ram Madhav, BJP general secretary and in-charge of the party’s AP unit, “Mr Naidu was never a reliable friend. The Telugu Desam was never a dependable ally at national level as he changes his views as per his political benefits.”When all Opposition parties are busy with the no- confidence motion in Delhi, Mr Naidu has confined himself to daily teleconferences with party MPs and has not visited Delhi to consult with the leaders of other political parties.The no-confidence motion against the NDA government has come in for criticism from parties who were friendly to the TD.Though the Shiromani Akali Dal has supported the TD’s decion to pull out of  the NDA, its floor leader in the Lok Sabha Naresh Gujral said “the current situation is such that we cannot decide who to trust”. The latest example of the inconsistencies in Mr Naidu’s position is the no-confidence motion.When the YSR Congress moved the no-confidence, Mr Naidu had said the TD will support it. But less than 12 hours later, he decided to move a no-trust vote against the NDA government himself. He said the TD could not support a no-trust vote moved by a party led by the number one accused in several cases.', 'New Delhi: Observing that there is large-scale misuse of the law, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that arrest of an accused is not mandatory under the provisions of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and accused are entitled for anticipatory bail.A Bench of justices Adarsh K.

Lalit gave this ruling on an appeal from Maharashtra government employee Dr. Subash Mahajan challenging a Bombay High Court verdict refusing to quash the FIR for his adverse remarks against an SC employee. The court held that there is a need to provide for safeguards against registration of FIRs and arrests under the SC/ST Act in view of instances of misuse, as observed in the last three decades.The Bench pointed out that this Act was enacted to protect the underprivileged against any atrocities. At the same time, the said Act cannot be converted into a charter for exploitation by any unscrupulous person or by police for extraneous reasons against other citizens. The Bench said the Act should promote constitutional values of fraternity and integration of the society and not result in perpetuating casteism which would have an adverse impact on integration of society.', 'Jammu: A former revenue official, wanted by the police in connection with the rape and killing of a minor girl in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday surrendered before the crime branch in Jammu, a senior police official said.Sanji Ram (60), believed to be the mastermind behind the rape and killing of the 8-year-old Bakharwal girl in January, surrendered after his son was arrested from Uttar Pradesh, the official said requesting anonymity.Earlier, an official had said investigation has revealed that it was a pre-planned killing carried out with the intention of instilling fear among the Bakharwal nomads residing in the area and driving them out. He had said the girl was drugged and raped before being killed.The minor’s body was recovered from Rasana forest in Kathua on January 17, a week after she went missing while grazing horses in the area. The incident sparked widespread protest in the state.On January 23, the state government handed over the case to the state police’s crime branch which formed an SIT and arrested six people, including two Special Police Officers (SPOs) and a head constable, who was charged with destruction of evidence. One of the arrested persons, who was said to be a juvenile, was subjected to medical examination at government medical college here on March 7 which opined that he was over 19-year-old.The crime branch submitted a detailed status report to the High Court on March 9 which is monitoring the case.The case has divided the ruling coalition partners, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), over the demand of a section of people to hand over the case to the CBI for a thorough investigation.On March 8, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti rejected the demand of BJP for a CBI investigation into the case saying 95 per cent of the probe has been completed. Several organisations, including the Bar Association and the Hindu Ekta Manch, had staged a sit-in in Kathua town on March 3 demanding a CBI inquiry into the case.On February 27, residents of Rasana village migrated to Hiranagar and blocked a road as a protest against the PDP-BJP government alleging harassment and mass detentions by the Jammu and Kashmir Police’s Crime Branch.Two BJP ministers – Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga – visited the protesters and supported their demand for a CBI probe. On March 4, senior BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh assured a fair probe in the case.', 'Several hotels in Meerut in Uttar Pradesh have become hubs for flesh trade. The police on Tuesday busted the sex racket by conducting raids at several hotels near the Sadar Bazar police station area and arrested as many as 35 men and women.The raids were conducted by the police at more than six hotels. As soon as the police action began at the hotels, several couples could be seen making attempts to either flee or hide themselves. However, with the help of women cops, the police managed to arrest them.Those arrested were brought to the police station in a bus. It is believed that the sex racket in hotels in the area have been running for years. It has also been alleged that many police officials have aided the sex racket in the past.', 'New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Tuesday arrested professor Atul Johri of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in an alleged sexual harassment case.The students of the university had been demanding the arrest of the professor for a couple of days now.“Four days after eight women students came forward with sexual harassment complaints against the professor, no action has been taken against him and just one FIR has been lodged,” Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) vice president Simone Zoya Khan had said earlier.Besides the students, JNU professors too had been demanding action against Johri. Accusing the police of disregarding the procedures, 54 professors of the university had earlier on Tuesday demanded registration of separate FIRs on the basis of all eight sexual harassment complaints against Johri. The students had raised slogans against the university officials and Delhi Police. A scuffle had broken out when some of them had tried to break the barricades put up by the police.The police had registered eight FIRs against Johri. “We have recorded the statements of the complainants. A few more female students have approached the police and levelled similar allegations against Johri. The investigation is being closely monitored by Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Monika Bhardwaj,” Joint Commissioner of Police Ajay Chaudhary had said earlier.The students had accused the police of shielding Johri from arrest.', 'New Delhi: Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said reforms are likely to be put on the shelf till the next general elections but expressed hope that the country will move up to a “higher plane of growth” thereafter.Rajan also raised concerns about employment generation, saying India’s 7.5 per cent growth will not be able create good jobs for the 12 million people coming into the labour market every year.The next general elections are scheduled in early 2019.“I think to some extent, reforms will be put on the shelf till the next election. But post-election, if we can accelerate this pace of reform, there’s no reason why in two or three years we couldn’t move up to a higher plane of growth,” he said in an interview to CNBC.Rajan, who is currently a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, further said India can move up from the 7.5 per cent growth, which is not enough to employ the 12 million people coming to the labour force every year in good jobs.“We can move up to maybe 10 per cent, provide some kind of source of demand for the work. We can do that but I think we need to work on it,” he observed.Rajan noted that reforms are happening in India but more slowly than one would wish.“That’s potentially the cost of getting political agreement,” he said.Noting that the world has become less receptive to exports, Rajan said,” So if India becomes a manufacturing giant overnight, who’s going to buy its stuff? So, India needs to think about its pathway of growth, it will be different from China’s.”', 'New Delhi: Indian Railways, flooded with complaints of over-priced food on social media, has taken several measures lately to check the issue.The Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) had even released a new menu card on its Twitter account to inform rail passengers about the food rates last year.In a latest move, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has taken a policy decision implying the food should be considered free or no payment should be made if the passengers don’t get any bills for it. The “No food bill, no payment” is widely practiced in malls, restaurants and cafes.The new order will allow passengers to insist on bills so that train caterers can be checked for overcharging.As per media reports, Railway ministry has instructed that trains where food is served on payment basis should have this policy in place by March 31. The Railway ministry is also reportedly deploying inspectors to check overcharging.Meanwhile, in June last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had said in a scathing report that the food sold at railway stations is “unfit for human consumption” and the hygiene standards at railway catering units are below parThe CAG performance audit found unpurified tap water being used to make beverages, uncovered and unwashed waste bins, food left out in the open, and rats and cockroaches at catering units in trains and stationsThe report was prepared after inspections at 74 stations and 80 trains, covering the period from 2013 to 2016 and issues of earlier years which could not be reported earlier', 'New York: Are you taking good care of your dental health? If yes, then you are at decreased risk of developing diabetes. A new study has warned that those who have poor dental hygiene are more prone to the disease.The study suggests that dental examination may provide a way to identify the risk of developing the disease.Lead author Raynald Samoa from the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California said, “We found a progressive positive relationship between worsening glucose tolerance and the number of missing teeth.”For the study, researchers reviewed the records of 9,670 adults with 20 years of age and above who were examined by dentists during the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.They analysed their reported body mass index (BMI) and glucose tolerance states by fasting plasma glucose, two-hour post-challenge plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), established diabetes and whether the condition was treated with oral agents or insulin.The researchers recorded the numbers of missing teeth due to caries, or cavities, and periodontal disease for individual patients.They also determined the relationship between glucose tolerance and dental condition by considering age, gender, racial and ethnic group, family history of diabetes, smoking status, alcohol consumption, education and poverty index.The researchers found a progressive increase in the number of patients with missing teeth as glucose tolerance declined, from 45.57 per cent in the group with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), to 67.61 per cent in the group with abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT), to 82.87 per cent in the group with diabetes mellitus (DM).The differences in the average number of missing teeth among the three glucose tolerance groups were significant: 2.26 in the NGT group, 4.41 in the AGT group and 6.80 in those with DM, the researchers noted.The study was presented at the ENDO 2018: The Endocrine Society’s 100th Annual Meeting and Expo.', 'Chennai:\\xa0Dinesh Karthik has become the toast of the nation with his 8-ball-29* against Bangladesh in the T20 tri-series final but he still feels like a “student in a\\xa0University where Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a topper”, when it comes to the tag of the best finisher.“When it comes to Dhoni — I am studying in a university where he is the topper. He is one of the guys I have always looked up to. It is unfair to compare me with him,” Karthik told mediapersons during an interaction here on Tuesday.Interestingly, Karthik made his international debut in September 2004 during the Champions Trophy in England, three months before Dhoni’s debut against Bangladesh in a bilateral series in December.In the next 14 years, Dhoni became India’s most successful captain and one of its greatest limited overs exponent, while Karthik struggled on the fringe, waiting for his chances.“His (Dhoni) journey has been totally different and my journey is a different one. He is a terrific guy. He is somebody who used to be reserved, shy. Today, he is a person who is really vocal in helping the youngsters. I feel these comparisons are very unfair. As I said, he is probably a topper in a\\xa0university, where I am studying. I am just happy in the space I am in,” Karthik said.Having been around for a decade and a half, Karthik is finally enjoying his time in the spotlight, something he has so richly deserved. He attributes it to his good karma and divine intervention.“It feels good that all the attention is on me. All the good karma and good things I have done over the years helped me hit that six. It is just that the shot went for a six… Probably the two mm extra that it went for it to become a six.”The feeling is yet to sink in and Karthik admitted it.“It is hard for me to put in words. I am just happy to play this sport. When you play domestic cricket, it is a hard grind, To suddenly get so much attention feels so good but you also know that you want this to be the start of something special,” he added.Karthik also said the time spent with Mumbai cricketer Abhishek Nayar over the years had helped him strengthen the mental aspect of his game.“He (Abhishek Nayar) has been the most important factor in the last two and half years in my career. He has helped me prepare for games. He has made me think in terms of strategy. He also knows what is the right way to work hard. He has been the river and I have been the boat,” he added.Karthik also defended rookie Vijay Shankar who didn’t have the experience of tackling Mustafizur Rahman’s slower deliveries.“Vijay Shankar has the skill. He has done really well as a bowler. For someone, who is a batting all-rounder, he did well under pressure. I see a really good future for him. He has got a good attitude. He is a special talent and he has it in him to play for a long, long time,” the 32-year-old stumper said.He may have been a bit upset with Rohit Sharma’s decision to promote Shankar ahead of him but lavished praise on Mumbaikar’s style of captaincy.“His (Rohit Sharma’s) biggest strength is that he has won three IPLs as skipper and has immense belief in his ability to lead a team. He does a lot of homework. He is strategically very strong. He is a very thorough captain and is someone who is highly-skilled,” Karthik said.Karthik has been named captain of Kolkata Knight Riders for the upcoming IPL and he would like to grow in stature after the platform that Nidahas Trophy has provided him with.“(The forthcoming) IPL is extremely\\xa0important. It is a fabulous league. Indian cricket is where it is because of the IPL. We get to rub shoulders with the best. On a personal note, it is a\\xa0very important league for me,” Karthik said.The feisty Karthik is excited about his new role and wants to live up to the legacy left behind by Gautam Gambhir.“I am very excited about the captaincy role. Maybe, it is time for me to embrace captaincy. The team has a very good bowling attack. I have to sit down with the coaches and see where I need to bat,” he added.About the return of CSK and Rajasthan Royals, he said it will add a lot to the league.“CSK and Rajasthan Royals bring a totally different dynamics to the game. I am sure it is going to be a fabulous league,” Karthik said.', 'Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan apparently broke the glass door in the wake of the Tigers’ win against Sri Lanka in the recently concluded Nidahas T20 tri-series at Colombo’s R Premadasa Stadium.In the penultimate match of the tournament, in what was also a virtual semi-final, Shakib gained a lot of bad name for himself. First, he tried to call his batsmen back from the field after what he considered erroneous umpiring calls against his team.And then after Mahmudullah miraculously hit 4,2,6 to take the Tigers into the final with one ball to spare, Shakib, according to the caterers around, caused damage to the dressing room glass door in a highly excited state as shards of glass littered the place. However, it wasn’t clear if the Bangladesh captain had really intended to break the door.Shakib, along with reserve player Nurul Hasan, was later punished by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Both Bangladeshi players were fined 25 per cent of their match fees besides being handed one demerit point.“Shakib was found to have breached Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game,” an ICC press release explained the nature of Shakib’s offence the next day after the game.Shakib himself was contrite ahead of the final which they lost to India on Sunday. “Many things happened that shouldn’t have happened. I need to remain calm. I was overjoyed and excitement was there. I must know how to react next time. I will be careful,” the all-rounder\\xa0said.“What happens in the field should never spill over off the field. To be honest, we are all good friends. We see each other in the Bangladesh Premier League and Dhaka Premier League. The two boards have great relations. We help each other a lot.

I am sure that both teams will never let it go off the field,”\\xa0he added.', 'Lisbon: Cristiano Ronaldo says the key to his staggering success is believing nobody is better than he is — and he advised his Portuguese teammates to adopt the same attitude.The Real Madrid star made the comments as he accepted the Portuguese player of the year award in Lisbon.“We should always believe we are the best,” said Ronaldo, who led Portugal to the Euro 2016 title and who is now turning his gaze to the 2018 World Cup.“You need to think big. I always believe that nobody is better than me, out on the pitch at least,” he said.“On a personal and collective level, I have had a dream year. I won five trophies (Champions League, UEFA Supercup, World Club Cup, Spanish league title and the Spanish Supercup), the Ballon D’Or and the FIFA ‘Best’ title.”Ronaldo, who has been voted Ballon D’Or winner five times, is currently in Lisbon with the Portugal squad who play fellow World Cup qualifiers Egypt on Friday and the Netherlands three days later.The 33-year-old has scored 79 goals in 147 games for Portugal and will lead the reigning European Champions to the 2018 World Cup, fitness permitting, where they will face Spain, Morocco and Iran in the first round.

The victims belong to Jhagrakhand area in Koriya located on the border of Chhattisgarh and MP, they added.Koriya Additional Superintendent of Police Nivedita Sharma said, “On March 4, the main accused Abhijeet Pal alias Pinku (20) took one of victims, with whom he was having an affair, on the pretext of marrying her. A friend of the victim accompanied them.”Sharma said Pal, a native of Khongapani village of Jhagrakhand, took the two minor girls to a place in Khongapani and raped them.“Later, Pal and eight of his friends repeatedly raped the two after confining them in Ledri and Bijuri villages,” she said.Officials said a complaint was filed by the victims’ families on the morning of March 18.The ASP said that a police team, on the basis of a tip-off, raided a place near Bijuri railway station in the early hours on Tuesday and rescued the girls.Seven of the nine accused were arrested during the rescue, Sharma said.They were identified as Ashraf Ali (26), Manoj Kumar (28), Hemraj Panika (20), Avinash (28), Jitendra Kumar Rai (26) and Rakesh Kumar Navait (23) apart from Pal, she said.A manhunt was underway for two more people, she said.They were booked on charges of gangrape, kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her to marry, wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement of the IPC and relevant provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the ASP added.', 'Washington: President Donald Trump spelt out in new detail several steps he favours to fight a US epidemic of opioid abuse, including the execution of drug dealers, a proposal that has gained little support from drug abuse and judicial experts.At an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump unveiled an anti-opioid abuse plan, including his death penalty recommendation, new funding for other initiatives and stiffer sentencing laws for drug dealers. He said the United States must “get tough” on opioids. “And that toughness includes the death penalty,” he said. Neither Trump nor the White House gave further details as to when it would be appropriate to seek the death penalty.Trump said that he was working with Congress to find USD 6 billion in new funding for 2018 and 2019 to fight the opioid crisis. The plan will also seek to cut opioid prescriptions by a third over three years by changing federal programs, he said.Addiction to opioids — mainly prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl — is a growing US problem, especially in rural areas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016.For Trump, the New Hampshire visit returned him to a state that gave him a key Republican primary election win when he was a political newcomer in 2016. Back then, he promised to tackle the opioid crisis, which is severe in the New England state.In October, he declared the crisis a public health emergency, but without providing more money. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said then that the declaration was meaningless without additional funds.In Manchester, Trump stopped at a local fire station that helps addicts get treatment. He was greeted by roughly 200 protesters, some chanting “You talk, we die.”Others carried signs, including one that read “Donald J. Duterte,” a reference to the Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal crackdown on drugs has lead to thousands of deaths.Free NarcanTrump said he wanted to give first responders access to life-saving drugs that can reverse overdoses. He said the nasal spray Narcan, which can block opioid effects in overdoses, would be provided free to US schools.He introduced Mike Kelly, an executive at Adapt Pharma, which makes Narcan, at the event. “We’ve provided, free-of-charge, four boxes to all colleges and universities in the United States. Two boxes free for every high school in the United States, as well as educational awareness,” Kelly said.Shares in Narcan seller Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Adapt’s commercial partner, rose sharply after Trump’s comments.Trump also said his plan would crack down on international and domestic illicit drug supply chains. Part of that would include requiring electronic data for 90 percent of international mail shipments with goods, he said.He said the United States would “engage with China and expand cooperation with Mexico to reduce supplies of heroin, other illicit opioids, and precursor chemicals.”The Justice Department will target negligent physicians and pharmacies, he said, adding that he was considering litigation against drug companies implicated in the opioid crisis.“We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. The death penalty is allowed in 31 states.Dr Harold Pollack, an urban public health professor at the University of Chicago, said, “I don’t think the death penalty for drug dealers will accomplish very much.”He said there was little evidence that tougher sentencing reduced the availability of street drugs and urged Trump to work with Republican state governors to expand the Medicaid federal health program so that drug addicts could get more access to healthcare and counselling.Ohio Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, in a statement, said Trump took too long to offer a plan, but praised him for offering “ambitious, evidence-based reforms.”He added, “I am disappointed that President Trump felt the need to… encourage prosecutors to seek the death penalty against drug dealers. I am all for punishing drug dealers, but I’m not for pushing the death penalty.”', 'Beijing: President Xi Jinping delivered a blistering nationalist speech on Tuesday, warning against any attempts to split China and touting the country’s readiness to fight “the bloody battle” to regain its rightful place in the world.Xi’s address capped an annual session of the National People’s Congress that paved the way for him to rule for life, as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong pushes through his vision of guiding the country through a “new era” of unrivalled global military and economic supremacy. Days after President Donald Trump signed new rules allowing top-level US officials to travel to Taiwan, Xi warned that Beijing would defend its “one China principle”, which sees the self-ruling island as its territory awaiting reunification.“All acts and tricks to separate the country are doomed to fail and will be condemned by the people and punished by history,” Xi said.But he also sought to address concerns about ambitious Chinese development projects abroad, saying they “will not pose a threat to any country.”“Only those who are accustomed to threatening others will see everyone as a threat,” he added.Xi used the speech to espouse his vision of realising the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” — the “greatest dream” of the world’s second-largest economy.“The Chinese people have been indomitable and persistent, we have the spirit of fighting the bloody battle against our enemies to the bitter end,” he said.But his speech was also a reminder that the Communist Party, more than ever, reigns over the country’s affairs.“History has already proven and will continue to prove that only socialism can save China,” he said.“The Communist Party is the supreme political leadership of the country and the fundamental guarantee to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”Indefinite RuleThe two-week session of the National People’s Congress handed Xi, 64, a second term and endorsed the Communist Party’s decision to lift presidential term limits, clearing the way for him to remain in power indefinitely after his second term ends in 2023.His eponymous political philosophy, which was enshrined in the party charter in 2017, was added to the national constitution and senior government officials had to swear an oath to the document for the first time.Some of Xi’s key lieutenants were also promoted to top positions. His former anti-corruption czar, Wang Qishan, was elevated to the vice presidency while his top economic adviser, Liu He, became vice premier.Wang could use his experience as a trade negotiator to deal with rocky relations with the Trump administration, while Liu is expected to have an influential role in economic policymaking.The legislature also approved the biggest government shake-up in years, merging the banking and insurance regulators to tackle financial risks, and amended the constitution to expand the Communist Party’s role in the country’s affairs.Xi’s campaign against corruption within the Communist Party, which punished 1.5 million officials in five years, was expanded as the legislature voted on Tuesday to create a national agency that will scrutinise millions of public servants.“The Communist Party of China must… resolutely eliminate” corruption, Xi said.The government’s propaganda machine worked in overdrive to nurture a cult of personality around Xi and stamp out dissenting views during the two-week session.The People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, referred to Xi as the “helmsman” last weekend, an echo of Mao who was known as “the great helmsman”.The abolition of term limits triggered a rare bout of criticism on social media, prompting censors to block dozens of phrases such as “I disagree” or “emperor” as well as satirical images such as Winnie the Pooh — the cartoon bear that some compare to Xi.China has stepped up its crackdown on civil society since Xi took power in 2012, tightening online restrictions and detaining hundreds of activists and lawyers.', 'Bengaluru: The government plans to develop 2 lakh km of highways and 12 expressways across the country, said Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday.“The Central government plans to develop 2 lakh km of highways and 12 expressways across the country with the help of state governments,” he said at an industry summit on ‘The Emerging New Growth Paradigm’, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here.Noting that progress in the road sector was growing at 28 km per day in this fiscal, Gadkari said the target would be 40 km per day in 2018-19.“Our government has signed work contracts for projects valued at Rs 850,000 crore for roads, ports, shipping, water resources in the coming years,” Gadkari told top executives of India Inc at the day-long event here.In Karnataka’s context, the minister said work on a new highway between Bengaluru and Mysuru at a cost of Rs 7,000 crore commenced on Saturday, and work on the Rs 16,000 crore expressway project between Bengaluru and Chennai is expected to start in early April.For developing the Karwar port in Karnataka, the minister said the Central government would spend Rs 3,000 crore on its projects if the state government agreed to give the required land.Advocating waterways as a means of cheaper logistical option, Gadkari said the government had called upon the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) to form a joint venture to manufacture seaplanes.“There is a need for 10,000 seaplanes over the next two years to ferry people and goods using them on waterways across the country,” reiterated Gadkari in the presence of HAL Chairman T. Suvarna Raju at the summit.Stressing on the need to check pollution, he urged the automobile sector to produce vehicles that run on electricity and alternate fuels like ethanol and methanol from agriculture waste, as conversion of waste into wealth is the future.Admitting that water conservation was a major concern in the country, Gadkari, who is also in charge of Water Resources, said planning than its shortage was the real issue.“Our government has decided to solve the water problems in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan by utilising water from rivers flowing into Pakistan,” he noted.The government has also introduced a scheme where water will reach farmlands using pipe system than canals, avoiding land acquisition costs to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore.The summit also deliberated on key areas including regulatory excellence, sustainability and diversity, global shocks, carbon footprint reduction commitment, diversity, job creation, industry 4.0, new-gen technologies, future of work and next generation leadership.', 'After targeting the Centre over pending court cases, Congress president Rahul Gandhi has now hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over appointment of judges to Supreme Court and High Courts. The Congress chief has alleged that more than 100 judges, whose names have been cleared for appointment in higher judiciary, are still awaiting approval from the NDA government.Taking to microblogging site Twitter, Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “ego was hurt” when the name of Justice KM Joseph was proposed for appointment to the Supreme Court. Justice Joseph had, in a verdict in 2016, overturned President’s rule in Uttarakhand as the Chief Justice of the state’s High Court.Using hashtag #JudiciaryDemonetised, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Justice K M Joseph, overturned President’s rule in Uttarakhand in 2016. When his name was proposed for the Supreme Court, Modi ji‘s ego was hurt. Approval of over 100 judges, cleared for the Supreme Court and various High Courts are now on hold.”In 2016, the Centre had imposed President’s rule in Uttarakhand, toppling Harish Rawat-led Congress government in the state. The Congress had challenged the decision in the High Court, accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of misusing its power. Justice KM Joseph later quashed the imposition of the President’s rule in the state.The attach by the Gandhi scion came after he raised concerns over millions of pending cases in courts and shortage of judges. Hitting out at Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rahul charged him with “peddling fake news” instead of strengthening the collapsing legal system.“Legal system collapsing under Pending Cases: Supreme Court 55,000+, High Court 37 Lakh+, Lower Courts 2.6 Crore+. Yet, a staggering 400 High Court and 6,000 Lower Court judges not appointed, while Law Minister preoccupied peddling fake news,” he had said on Twitter, using the hashtag #JudiciaryDemonetised.', 'New Delhi: BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday said that ‘a bomb to every bullet coming from Pakistan’ is the only solution to cross-border terrorism and infiltration.Shah made these remarks while speaking to a TV channel during which he said that the country’s armed forces will respond with a bomb to every Pakistani bullet. “This is the only solution. We can’t have peace talks amid bullets and bombs,” he was quoted as saying while replying to a query why despite the surgical strikes, the situation along the Line of Control has not changed with Pakistan still infiltrating terrorists into India.Shifting focus to party’s loss in recent Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, Shah claimed that the BJP will win with a massive majority in the forthcoming Karnataka assembly polls and the 2019 General Elections under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We have formed a committee to look into the reason for the losses and will deliberate on its report. Bypolls are fought with local issues in mind. Every local poll has different dynamics. But in general elections, big leaders and issues are involved. In 2019, the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will get more seats,” Shah said.Shah stated that the BJP started preparation for 2019 Lok Sabha polls the very next day after the government took oath in 2014. “We will contest the elections under his (Modi) guidance and popularity. The way Narendra Modi has run the government for four years, every state feels that India is going ahead. He is one of the most popular leaders in the world,” he said.When asked to comment if his party could win more than 50 seats in 2019 if Samajwadi Party and Mayawati’s BSP come together, he said, “This is not easy. Now, the media is gung-ho about the results in these two seats (Gorakhpur and Phulpur). We have lost eight seats, but have won in 11 states so far. No one mentions Tripura, where we won with a clean sweep.”Shah also ridiculed Congress president Rahul Gandhi for visiting temples, churches and mosques in Karnataka to win over voters. “He went to temples in Gujarat and Himachal too. But what happened? After 1967, the Congress has never won more than 50 percent of votes. We won 50 percent of votes in Gujarat, Himachal and Tripura. To win 50 percent of votes in a multiparty democratic system is a big mandate,” he said.Asked about election promises made during 2014 Lok Sabha poll campaign and party’s biggest achievement that it will tout in the general elections, Shah said the BJP has tried to raise the living standard of the poor, brought in an impartial and decisive government and boosted India’s pride and image.On Sonia Gandhi’s likening of BJP’s slogan ‘India Shining’ in 2004, with the party’s 2014 winning slogan ‘Achhe din aane waale hain’, Shah shot back, “What do you expect from her. Will she say Modi will win?”He added that could anyone imagine that India will carry out surgical strike across the border like Israel and America to avenge the deaths of our soldiers, ISRO will place 104 satellites in the orbit and an Indian PM would address the plenary session of the World Economic Forum.Shah also heaped praise on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying the state is on the right track. “There is zero corruption, problems of farmers have been solved and there is law and order. Many investment summits will be held. Akhilesh Yadav (former chief minister) could not hold such summits fearing untoward incidents. The state is moving in the right direction and will have double-digit growth,” he said.(With IANS inputs)', \"PATNA: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav was on Saturday sentenced to fourteen years in prison and fined Rs 60 lakh in connection with the fourth fodder scam case.

We expect a sunroof to be exclusive to top-spec versions of the updated SUV, and the inclusion is to meet the growing demand for the feature across car segments. A sunroof is a key differentiator on the Honda WR-V cross hatchback, for instance.   Going by the spy pics, the facelifted Creta for India is likely to get styling similar to the one sold in the South American markets.

The grille merges with the chunky new front bumper that sports creases and has separate housings for the fog lamps. Also new is a thick black chin that further enhances the SUV’s muscular appearance. At the rear, the new Creta will get a slightly redesigned bumper, and there are chances it’ll come with mildly tweaked tail-lamps with LED inserts as well.

I did not realise it would cause all this,” Shikder said when paraded before television cameras.Betting is illegal in Bangladesh.

No refugees who fled a military crackdown in Myanmar would be moved there against their will, he added.Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed the border from Myanmar’s Rakhine state since August, and are in cramped camps at Cox’s Bazar. Because a repatriation deal between the neighbouring countries has been delayed, Bangladesh aims to prepare new homes on the nearby island, called Bhasan Char, before the onset of seasonal monsoon rains that could come in late April.“We don’t have a timeline because it’s a lot of money,” Alam said at Bangladesh’s United Nations office in New York. “We are so far building it with our own finances. I am not very hopeful about how much funds the international community will be able to raise.”The latest wave of refugees joined about 300,000 Rohingyas already in Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest and most crowded countries, who fled previous bouts of violence.

Upset over this, Saini hurled a shoe at Anna Hazare’s press conference to express his anger.A video of the incident also later surfaced on the social networking platform Twitter. #WATCH Shoe hurled at stage while Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis addressed farmers' protest lead by Anna Hazare at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan pic.twitter.com/BmYVWPKazG— ANI (@ANI) March 29, 2018The incident came shortly after Anna ended his hunger strike – six days after he began his agitation at the Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi demanding a competent Lokpal.Noted social crusader Anna Hazare on Thursday ended his hunger strike – six days after he began his agitation at the Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi demanding a competent Lokpal and adequate measures to address the agrarian crisis in the country.Anna Hazare ended his agitation after meeting Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.Delhi: Anna Hazare ends hunger strike after talks with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat pic.twitter.com/S1gtclNuoc— ANI (@ANI) March 29, 2018Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat too met Anna Hazare at the protest site in Delhi today. Singh and Fadnavis visited Anna in view of reports about his fast deteriorating health. Anna’s doctor had said on Wednesday that his blood pressure was high and sugar levels low, which made him feel exhausted. Anna had also lost some weight due to the hunger strike.Though Anna ended his fast, he gave a six-month deadline to the Centre to fulfill all his demands, failing which, he said, a fresh agitation would be launched across the country. The noted anti-corruption crusader had begun an indefinite hunger strike at Ramlila Ground demanding a competent Lokpal and better production cost for farm produce.After beginning the fast, Anna Hazare had said that he would not let any political party join him. Anna had said that whoever will join the movement with him, has to sign an affidavit stating that they’ll neither join any political party or a group and that he will never contest elections.“Whoever joins the movement, signs affidavit which states, that they’ll neither join any political party or group nor will contest elections, ensure service to country, society and maintain good character. I’ll not let any political party or group come on this stage,” Hazare said.Hazare has been pressing for the setting up of a Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in the states to probe corruption cases, bring in new electoral reforms and implementation of the MS Swaminathan Committee report to address the agrarian crisis in the country. According to informed sources, the government is ready to accept almost all of the demands but it has reservations about the implementation of the demands in a time-bound manner.

The premium luxury SUV had also won the North American Utility of the Year Award earlier this year.Håkan Samuelsson, president and CEO of Volvo Cars, said at the occasion, “I am pleased to see our company’s product investments paying off. We are up against some tough competition, but this award for the XC60 show that Volvo has the right combination of design, connectivity and safety that appeals to customers across the world.”While the XC60 in international markets is sold with a range of petrol and diesel engines, including a petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, the SUV is sold in India at Rs 55.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India) in a single Inscription trim. It is powered by a four-cylinder, 2.0-litre diesel engine that produces 235hp and 480Nm of peak torque, and is mated to an eight-speed automatic that powers all-four-wheels.As per our review, the XC60 boasts air-suspension, a segment-first massage function for the front seats, and a variety of radar-based features such as blind spot assist, lane-keeping aid, autonomous braking, and adaptive cruise control.', 'New York: Spending a fun-filled childhood with friends can help boys to have good physical health in adulthood, according to a new study.“These findings suggest that our early social lives may have a small protective influence on our physical health in adulthood,” said co-author Jenny Cundiff of Texas Tech University in the US.“It’s not just our care-givers or financial circumstances, but also our friends who may be health protective,” added Cundiff. For the study, published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers examined a longitudinal study following cohorts of boys who were initially recruited to participate as students. Specifically, they examined data from 267 individuals in the youngest cohort, most of whom were Black (about 56 percent) or White (about 41 percent).The participants’ parents reported how much time their children spent with their friends during an average week, beginning when the boys were about six-years-old and continuing through age 16. The study shows that boys who spent more time with friends as children tend to have lower blood pressure (BP) and lower Body Mass Index (BMI) as men in their early 30s.This association was held even after the researchers accounted for other potential influences, including physical health in childhood, and social integration in adulthood.The researchers noted that expanding the scope of measures used in future research could help to illuminate the pathways that link early peer relationships with physical health decades later.', 'GUNTUR: The Guntur Rural police arrested the accused in the rape of a four-year-old girl.

It will show Armaan searching for his loved one. “Bhushanji (Bhushan Kumar) had played this song to me in his office and he said he wanted me to do this song as my next single as it had this boy-next-door vibe to it and felt that I would fit it perfectly,” Armaan said in a statement.“Amaal already knew this song and was a fan of the melody and the composer Rajesh Roshanji. When he learned that I also featured in the video, Amaal, without any hesitation said that he wants to work on it and give it his twist. From there on, the song just kept on getting grander and much more beautiful than what I had in mind for it,” he added.Known for chartbusters like “Bol do na zara”, “Naina” and “Main hoon hero tera”, Amaal said: “I have tried to maintain the original essence of the song without tampering with it much. I’ve given it my style of production and also healthily contributed melodically.”Armaan added that apart from the chorus line — “Ghar se nikalte hi, kuch door chalte hi raste mein hai uska ghar” — everything else is “completely fresh”.The lyrics of the song have been penned by Kunal Verma.

', 'Mumbai: Director Karthik Subbaraj says iconic dancer-actor-filmmaker Prabhudheva will not be seen dancing in their film ‘Mercury’.“Though I cast Prabhudheva, there is no dance sequence in the film. Perhaps that is why he must have found the film interesting and agreed to do it because he is known for his dance and gets offers of dance films every now and then. I went to him with the story where he is playing the antagonist. It is a very different kind of Prabhudheva that the audience will get to see,” Subbaraj told IANS.While the song “Mercury” is getting appreciation from people online, the director mentioned: “That is a promotional video because we are releasing the film pan India. That’s the only time when Prabhu Sir danced, but it is not a part of the film.”The silent thriller has an element of mystery and the darker side of industrial development. “The film deals with corporate exploitation in small towns and mother nature. There are many examples that we have seen in the past also like the Bhopal gas tragedy. One of the reasons why I wanted to make it a silent film was to address an issue that is universal, that has no language barrier. “I think silence could also be a louder voice if expressed correctly. Cinema is a visual medium. So, I treated the story with visuals,” shared the director about “Mercury”, which is releasing on April 13.Born and brought up in a traditional south Indian family, Subbaraj started his career as a software engineer before joining the film industry.“I would say my parents were really supportive after a point. I had to prove to them that I am not just dreaming, I can really make it. I started learning filmmaking by joining a weekend film school in Bengaluru. I made some amateur short films that got appreciation from people around me,” he said.Subbaraj has made short films like “Kaatchipizhai”, “Who’s the Indian”, “Petty Case”, “Broken Gods” and “Raavanam”.“I think that… to an extent gave my parents some amount of confidence before I told them that I want to quit my job,” said the director.“I have also started my production house for creating and supporting good content. We have produced a Tamil web series that will soon stream on ZEE5 OTT platform. It is titled ‘Kallachiruppu’,” he shared.He is also excited about his next directorial venture.“I am working on my next with our all-time favourite Rajinikanth Sir. There is a mixed feeling of pressure and excitement. I am a huge Rajinikanth fan and this is a dream that is coming true. Now I am working on its pre-production so, I cannot talk much about it.

Spare a thought for their families as they have much to endure along with the players. Time for all of us to take a step back and give them some space,” Tendulkar wrote on Twitter. Smith and Warner were banned for a year by the Cricket Australia for their leadership role in the ball-tampering act during the third Test match in Cape Town, while Cameron Bancroft was handed a nine-month ban.Earlier, Tendulkar expressed that the ball-tampering act was unfortunate and said the one-year ban for the erring cricketers was a right decision.“Cricket has been known as a gentleman’s game. It’s a game that I believe should be played in the purest form. Whatever has happened is unfortunate but the right decision has been taken to uphold the integrity of the game. Winning is important but the way you win is more important,” the 44-year-old said.Earlier, the Cricket Australia found all the three players guilty of breaching article 2.3.5 of Cricket Australia’s Code of Conduct and were sent back home from South Africa on Thursday.', 'Mumbai: Spinners finally came to party to give India their first win in the Women’s Twenty20 Tri-Series at Brabourne stadium on Thursday. The Harmanpreet Kaur led side ended the tournament with comfortable eight-wicket win over England.Slow bowlers Anuja Patil, Radha Yadav, Deepti Sharma and Poonam Yadav foxed the England middle-order batswomen on a pitch that offered some assistance to them. The spinners shared nine wickets between them after Pooja Vastrakar removed opener Amy Jones. Man-of-the-match Anuja picked three wickets while other three slow bowlers picked two wickets apiece. England, who had chased 198 in their previous match against India, were going on nicely with second match centurion Danielle Wyatt in full control. The turnaround came when off-spinner Deepti dismissed Wyatt with a reflexive catch on her own bowling. The visitors who were bowled out for 96 against Australia on Wednesday managed 107 in 18.5 overs on Thursday after staying pretty at 59/1 in seventh over. Wyatt’s wicket after she top scored with 22-ball 31 brought out another England collapse. Indian spinners were getting firm grip from the pitch and England lower order had no answers.India led by opener Smriti Mandhana (62 not out) chased down the target in 15.4 overs. Mandhana notched her third 60 plus score of the tournament. She started with three back-to-back boundaries of Katie George. Tamsin Beaumont dropped a sitter in the same over when Mandhana was on 13. She sizzled in company of composed Harmanpreet (20 not out) to steer India home with 60-run partnership for third wicket after Mithali Raj and Jemimah Rodrigues gave away their wickets cheaply.

The talks were the first between the two Koreas since the delegation returned from the North.A South Korean unification ministry official told reporters the two Koreas would hold a working-level meeting on April 4 to discuss details for the summit, such as staffing support, security and news releases.They are technically still at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce.Kim is also scheduled to meet Donald Trump some time in May to discuss denuclearisation, even though a time and place have not been set for that summit.Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a  visit to Beijing this week, his first trip outside the isolated North since he came to power in 2011.', 'Caracas: A fire allegedly set during an attempted jailbreak from Venezuelan police holding cells killed 68 people on Wednesday, the country’s top prosecutor and an inmates’ rights group said.The blaze at the detention facility in Carabobo state is the latest in a series of deadly incidents in Venezuela’s overcrowded jails. “In light of the terrible events that took place in the Carabobo state police headquarters, where 68 people died in a presumed fire, we have appointed four prosecutors… to clarify these dramatic events,” chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab said on Twitter.Carlos Nieto, head of Una Ventana a la Libertad (A Window on Freedom), said that “some burned to death and others asphyxiated” after setting fire to mattresses and stealing a guard’s gun in an attempt to break out.The dead included two women thought to have been visiting the jail at the time of the incident, Nieto said.Rafael Lacava, the governor of Carabobo state, expressed his “consternation” over the events but did not provide a toll.“A serious and profound investigation has been initiated to find the causes and those responsible for these regrettable events,” he said on Twitter, expressing solidarity with relatives of those who died.Relatives of those being kept in the detention center tried to force their way into Carabobo state police headquarters. After one officer was injured by a stone, the crowd was dispersed by police firing tear gas.A video posted on Twitter showed dozens of people demanding information in front of police guarding the site.“I am a desperate mother. My son has been here a week. They have not given any information,” Dora Blanco told local media.Dire prison conditionsVenezuela’s prisons suffer from dire overcrowding and a shortage of basic supplies, struggling under the deepening economic crisis that is gripping the once-wealthy oil-producing country.Because of the lack of space in penitentiaries, convicts are often sent to police holding cells like the ones in Carabobo, meant to be used as temporary pens for suspects facing charges or court hearings, where detainees are supposed to spend a maximum of 48 hours.Nieto’s association estimated that the temporary detention centres were overfilled by five times their capacity.“All the police stations in Venezuela are facing similar or worse conditions of overcrowding, lack of food and disease,” he said.The association said 65 people died last year in the holding cells due to violence, malnutrition or tuberculosis.Two weeks ago, 58 detainees escaped holding cells on Margarita Island, a favoured tourist spot, when a hole opened up in their facility’s wall. They were all soon recaptured.In August 2017, a riot left 37 dead and 14 wounded in police cells in the southern state of Amazonas, while an April 2017 clash between rival gangs left 12 dead and 11 injured in the Puente Ayala prison in the eastern city of Barcelona.A month before that, the remains of 14 people were found in a mass grave in the General Penitentiary of Venezuela, in San Juan de Los Morros in the country’s centre.', 'Gold Coast: An Indian man has been charged with people smuggling after arriving at Australia’s Brisbane airport with eight other travellers as part of a “fake media contingent” to cover the Commonwealth Games, authorities said Thursday.The nine visitors, all from India, were flagged as possible “non-genuine travellers” when they transited through Thailand and were questioned when they arrived in Brisbane Wednesday, the Australian Border Force (ABF) said. “Eight were found to have fraudulent foreign media credentials,” the border force said in a statement.“Police will allege in court that the 46-year-old Indian national who did hold valid credentials was facilitating the group’s travel.”The man was charged with one count of people smuggling and one count of having false documents and false or misleading information in relation to non-citizens.The maximum penalty for each charge is 20 years’ jail.He faced Brisbane Magistrates Court Thursday and was remanded in custody. He is due to re-appear in court on April 6, a court official told AFP.The eight others, whose ages and gender were not released, were being held in immigration detention.“The ABF remains highly alert to other similar attempts that may occur as we get closer to the start of the Commonwealth Games,” the Border Force’s Queensland Regional Commander Terry Price said.Queensland Police’s Assistant Commissioner Bob Gee told reporters there was no threat to the multi-sport event, which runs on the Gold Coast from April 4-15.Australia’s Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has already warned Commonwealth Games athletes and support staff not to overstay their visas.', 'London: An Indian-origin drunk-driver in the UK, who hit and killed three teenage boys as they walked to a birthday party in London, was handed down a 13-year jail term. The victims’ parents, reacting to the sentencing, said the jail term was “an insult to the lives of their children”.Jaynesh Chudasama, 28, had admitted to driving at more than two-and-a-half times over the alcohol limit on January 26 when the fatal collision occurred near a bus stop at Hayes, West London. The court heard that traces of cannabis had also been found in his car hire worker’s system.Chudasama had pleaded guilty to charges of three counts of death by dangerous driving after the road collision that killed three teenage boys.Harry Rice, 17, George Wilkinson and Josh McGuinness, both 16, were instantly killed as they were hit by Chudasama’s speeding car.“It is obvious that nothing any court can do can measure the loss of Josh, Harry and George for the obvious reason that their loss is immeasurable,” said Judge Wendy Joseph, during the sentencing hearing.The judge also disqualified Chudasama from driving for 13 years and six months.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the drunk-driver had refused to say what he had been drinking but was estimated to have had a blood alcohol concentration of about 213 milligrams per 100 millilitres at the time of the crash.The legal limit for driving in the UK is 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.“The decision by Jaynesh Chudasama, to drink far in excess of the legal limit and then drive his car at such a speed, needlessly ended the lives of three young men,” said Sally-Anne Russell of the CPS.“Anyone who drives a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of excess alcohol should know they are putting not only their own lives at risk, but those of other motorists and pedestrians too. Chudasama faces the consequences of causing the fatal collision,” she said.Chudasama was driving at 71 mph in a 60 mph zone and ended up mounting the pavement in his car as he attempted a dangerous manoeuvre to overtake another vehicle, killing the three teenagers walking home with five other friends from a birthday party.The grieving families are planning online petitions to demand the conviction be reconsidered and a charge of murder applied to the dangerous driving charge, which would involve a tougher sentence.Tracy Blackwell, mother of Josh McGuinness who was killed in the crash, said Chudasama should be made an example of.She told the court: “He chose to hit our children at this speed when they were walking on the pavement, where they should have been safe. He chose to run away like a coward. I truly believe he would not be in this country if he had been able to get away”.As she stepped down from the witness stand, she told Chudasama in the dock: “You’re going to rot in hell, mate”. Despite the efforts of paramedics, all three boys were pronounced dead at the scene.“We are all shocked and deeply saddened. Our thoughts and condolences are with their families, friends and loved ones,” the head-teacher of Harefield Academy, the school attended by the victims, had said at the time of the accident.Photographs from the scene showed the smashed wreckage of the car, including a caved-in fence.', 'New Delhi/Washington: Acknowledging that unemployment is a major challenge that India is facing currently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday exuded confidence that the reforms being carried out in India in the last few years would end up creating new jobs in the country.“Clearly India faces a challenge in terms of providing sufficient employment for a number of people looking for work and particularly young people. But yes, the measures and the reforms that India is undertaking will over medium term create jobs,” the IMF spokesperson, Gerry Rice, told reporters at a news conference in Washinton. Noting that India has been one of the fastest growing large economies in recent times, he said this has led to improvement in reducing poverty and improvements in living standards.“Our view is that recent reforms, particularly the implementation of GST, national goods and services tax, should help boost efficiency and productivity and overtime will contribute to help them create jobs in the formal sector,” Rice said when asked if India is experiencing jobless growth.In addition, the government recently took steps towards labor market flexibility by modifying labor rules. “We think that these reforms will help to increase employment, perhaps not overnight but over the medium term,” he said.And the continuation of micro economic policies, structural forms including reforms in the labor market, will not only boosts India’s long-term growth but create jobs as well, Rice said.“So we think, all of this will help to spur India’s continuing catch up with advanced economies and create many jobs that are needed to employ people who are going to labor force,” Rice said.', 'Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is slated to inaugurate a 10.5-km elevated road in Ghaziabad on Friday. Hindon Elevated Road project is the longest elevated road in the country and has been built at a whopping cost of Rs 1147 crore.The road connects UP Gate at Delhi-Ghaziabad border to Rajnagar Extension, and is expected to provide big relief to commuters going to Meerut.The construction of the road was completed one year back, and was one of the initiatives of previous Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh. It is believed that the inauguration of the elevated road might lead to a war of words between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the SP over taking the credit for the same.On the sidelines of the inauguration of the road, the UP Chief Minister is also expected to launch other projects worth Rs 341.48 crore. These projects are from different departments such as power corporation, PWD, primary education and district administration.Almost 15 days back, some members of the Ghaziabad unit of the Samajwadi Party had inaugurated the road, following which the police registered an FIR against SP’s Legislative Council Member Rakesh Yadav and several unnamed workers.SP workers said that since the project was a brainchild of the erstwhile SP-led state government and the work on it was also started by the SP government, Akhilesh Yadav should inaugurate the project. They alleged that the ruling BJP is taking all the credit.“Over 90% of the work on the road was completed during the SP government, and only the finishing touches were left. All the funding was generated by our government. The final work was being delayed by the BJP government to show the public that it was their feat,” SP’s Ghaziabad president had told DNA.', 'London: An Indian-origin teenager was found hanging in the premises of a top UK grammar school as she felt excluded after her classmates did not include her in a WhatsApp group, according to an inquiry into her death this week. 14-year-old Elena Mondal was found by her teachers, hanging unresponsive, at Hampstead’s Henrietta Barnett School in north London last year. Psychiatrist Emily Hallgarten told Barnet Coroner’s Court that the 14-year-old may have felt excluded after her friends did not include her in a WhatsApp group, the Sun reported.School officials told the inquest how Elena Mondal, who wanted to be a doctor, once fled a classroom in tears clutching a pair of scissors, before collapsing in a corridor and cutting her arms in a toilet.According to the probe the girl’s parents, Shyamal and Moushumi Mondal, had feared that their daughter was being bullied at the girls’ school, which was ranked the top performing state-funded school in the UK in 2016 and 2017.A well-being manager at the school, Kelly Barry, said that the girl had been referred to the school counsellor after missing meals and complaining of depression but had missed several appointments.When asked if the school’s “hothouse culture” could be putting pupils at risk of mental health issues, she said: “It is not unusual for teenage girls at different points to engage in experiments with food or self-harm.” Consultant psychiatrist Cathy Wainhouse added that Elena Mondal may not have intended to die instead hoping that she would be found by friends before her “dramatic statement” went wrong.The inquest has been put back until an expert psychiatrist can assess reports from the physiological care provided to Elena Mondal before her death.', 'Mumbai: Hollywood veteran Arnold Schwarzenegger reportedly underwent emergency open-heart surgery on Thursday due to complications that arose from a previous heart surgery.According to the Fox News, 70-year-old Schwarzenegger went to the hospital for an experimental procedure to replace a catheter valve where he developed certain complications forcing the doctors to perform an open heart surgery on the actor. The catheter valve replacement procedure is conducted to avoid the open heart surgery.The surgeons have reported the actor to be in a stable condition.Earlier in 1997, the Terminator-star reportedly underwent a different heart surgery to replace an aortic valve.

A professor of economics at Columbia University, Panagariya, had further said that predominance of scandals and NPAs in PSBs is only one albeit important reason for privatisation of PSBs.“I firmly believe that privatisation of all PSBs except perhaps the State Bank of India should be on the election manifestos of all parties who wish to present themselves as serious candidates to form the government in 2019,” he had told PTI.

On being questioned, the students and tutors revealed that they got the papers from someone else.The police have also sought the details of the e-mail address from Google to identify the source from where the Central Board of Secondary Education chairperson was sent a mail on the Class 10 mathematics paper being leaked.The Delhi Police Crime Branch had sought details of the examination centres, their superintendents and the contacts of banks where the papers were kept for safekeeping and these have been furnished by the board, the official said.“The papers (economics and mathematics) were shared on over 10 WhatsApp groups, comprising 50-60 members. These groups were active in outer Delhi and border areas of Delhi and Haryana. Four numbers that the CBSE had mentioned in their complaint were used to circulate the Class 12 economics paper were traced and through them the police traced these WhatsApp groups and their admins,” the official said.The WhatsApp groups mostly comprise students and tutors and some of them had common members, the official said.“If we are able to establish the link of any of these WhatsApp group members with those connected to officials related to the examination process, we might question the latter as we have got their details from the board,” the official added.The CBSE also informed the police that they had received five complaints informing them that the two papers were leaked, another official said, adding that the contents of these complaints have been shared with them and will be examined.In the complaint pertaining to the mathematics paper, the board has said that a day before the exam, an e-mail was received on the CBSE chairperson’s official ID informing about the leak, the officials said.In the email, the sender had stated that the mathematics paper was leaked on WhatsApp and that it should be cancelled, they said.The mail also contained 12 images of the handwritten mathematics paper allegedly leaked on WhatsApp, according to the complaint.In its complaint to the police, the board had said that they received a complaint by fax on March 23 from an “unknown source” that a man running a coaching institute in Rajendra Nagar was involved in leaking the economics paper.The complaint also named two schools in Rajendra Nagar for their involvement in the alleged leak.The police said that so far, they have not found any clue to indicate that the schools were involved and it appears that it was an act of mischief. They have also asked the board to share the fax number from which the anonymous fax was received.Yesterday, the police “interacted” with three officials of the Board — the Controller of Examinations, Regional director CBSE, Delhi and secretary to understand the examination process and other details pertaining to papers being set.On March 26, when the students sat for the economics paper, the CBSE Academic unit at Rouse Avenue received an unaddressed envelope in the evening containing four sheets of hand written answers of the economics paper.The Delhi Police has registered two cases in connection with the leaks. The first case relating to the leak of the economics paper was lodged on March 27 and the other pertaining to the mathematics paper was lodged on March 28, following a complaint by the regional director of the CBSE.The cases were registered on charges of criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy.A Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising two deputy commissioners of police, four assistant commissioners and five inspectors has been set up to investigate the matter.The team is being supervised by the joint commissioner of police (crime).(With inputs from PTI)', 'Gorakhpur: A defamation case has been registered against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Congress party’s National Conclave which was held in New Delhi recently.The case against the Gandhi scion was filed by BJP leader Shalabh Mani Tripathi.BJP spokesperson Shalabh Mani Tripathi filed the defamation complaint at the Deoria district fast-track court under IPC sections 499 and 500 (defamation).Giving more details, Tripathi’s counsel said the matter will come up for hearing on April 5.“During the Congress party national conclave in Delhi, Rahul Gandhi tried to draw similarities between PM Modi, Nirav Modi (tainted diamond businessman) and Lalit Modi (former IPL commissioner),” Tripathi was later quoted as saying by the PTI.Tripathi further stated that Rahul, during his speech at the Congress Conclave, also said the name Modi had become synonymous to corruption. The BJP leader said that Rahul Gandhi’s remark has hurt the sentiments of saffron party workers and countrymen and that’s why he decided to file a defamation case against him in Deoria court.However, reacting to the development, the Congress said it would keep raising voice against government’s policies and its “failure” to check corruption.“It is our duty to raise issues related to the people of the country and we will continue to do so,” Congress district general secretary Anwar Hussain told PTI. “We are ready to face court cases and even jail for the country,” he added.Rahul Gandhi had compared PM Modi with Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi, both accused of fleeing the country after massive fraud, while addressing the three-day Congress national conclave in Delhi which began from March 16.Congress president has been regularly attacking the Narendra Modi government over various issues like 39 Indians’ murder in Iraq, CBSE papers leak, GST, notes ban and India-China standoff over Doklam etc. Referring to a poll conducted by him on Twitter, the Congress chief recently said that thousands took part in it and voted on how PM Modi would deal with any future Doklam-like situation with China.Taking a jibe at PM Modi, the Gandhi scion had tweeted, “Last week thousands took my Twitter poll. 63% felt Modi Ji would use hugplomacy, blame RM and cry in public to deal with the Doklam issue! For India’s sake, I hope you were wrong and our 56-inch strongman has a plan.”(With PTI inputs)', 'New Delhi: The number mobile internet users in India is estimated to touch 47.8 crore by June 2018, buoyed by cheaper smartphones, faster connectivity, and affordable services, according to an IAMAI report.The number of mobile internet users stood at 45.6 crore in December 2017, over 17 percent higher than December 2016, said the report titled ‘Mobile Internet in India 2017’ that also identified young students as being the most prolific consumer of such services.“The number of mobile internet users is estimated to reach 47.8 crore by June 2018… Handset manufacturers have been producing more affordable smartphone/feature phones, while telecom service providers are now offering better connectivity at more affordable prices,” said the joint report by Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and KANTAR-IMRB.The report estimates 29.1 crore urban mobile internet users, with 18.7 crore rural users by June. “Urban India witnessed an estimated 18.64 percent year-on-year rise, while rural India witnessed an estimated growth of 15.03 percent during the same period,” it said.The report forecast that given a 59 percent penetration, urban India is expected to witness a slowdown, while rural India with only 18 percent mobile internet penetration would emerge as the next area of growth.It also revealed that mobile internet is predominantly used by youngsters, with 46 percent of urban users and 57 percent of rural users below the age of 25.“Urban India has around twice the proportion of users over the age of 45, while the age range of 25 to 44 has the almost equal distribution of users in urban and rural areas,” an IAMAI statement said detailing out the usage pattern across various age brackets.Young students turned out to be the “most prolific users of most services”, while middle-aged and older men show the greater propensity of using social networking and browsing. “Working women have the highest propensity of social networking and browsing, while non-working women have the highest propensity for text chatting,” it said.The voice-related mobile spends have been coming down since 2013, and the popularity of Voice over IP (VoIP) and video chatting have further amplified this trend.This, in turn, led to a rise in the proportion of data expenditure in comparison to voice expenditures for most users. Between 2013 and 2017, the ratio of data to voice went up from 45:55 to 84:16, the IAMAI said.The report, however, noted that while mobile internet usage is fuelling internet penetration in India, it still remains confined to a few specific service categories.“The advent of digital entertainment has had the considerable impact on mobile internet usage. Streaming services have a symbiotic linkage with usage growth,” it said.Telecom operators now bundle subscription of such services with their offerings to woo customers and users are more likely to take up higher quality connections to ensure faster streaming and better audio and video quality services, it noted.', 'MG Motor India is gearing up to foray into India with its first model – a Creta-rivaling mid-size SUV – in the first half of 2019, and work towards reconstructing its Halol plant, acquired from GM, is on in full steam. The carmaker admits establishing itself in India will be a tough job. Performance of global automakers such as GM, Volkswagen, Renault-Nissan, Skoda, Fiat and Ford shows that gaining presence is not easy.“I’m the first one to say, it’s not an easy job. That’s why we need to do things in a different way; everything from product selection, product features to product assurance, customer experience and post sale experience has to be carried out in a more meaningful and compelling way,” Rajeev Chaba, president & managing director, MG Motor India said. “There is no silver bullet in the auto industry. Our advantage is we that don’t have any baggage,” he added.In an effort to better take on competition from established rivals such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai, MG aims to adopt an approach with strong emphasis on attractive prices, high localisation and a richer customer experience. The stress could be particularly more on customer experience of the brand. “There’s a lot of scope and opportunity in that area in our country, be it sales, be it after-sales,” Chaba told our sister publication Autocar Professional.MG is targeting a premium positioning to establish its brand – much like fellow newcomer Kia – and Chaba confirmed the first SUV, to be launched in the first quarter of 2019, will be over four metres in length. The India-specific model is set to lock horns with the hugely popular Hyundai Creta. “We would have to introduce a sub-four-metre SUV at some point of time, since participation in most of the segments is imperative to become a mainstream player, so I wouldn’t rule that out, but at this point of time we don’t have a plan,” he added. After introducing the SUV, the carmaker intends to introduce one new product every year.Apart from a promising product, MG understands having an affordable price tag is crucial to attract more buyers and is targeting a high level of localisation. It has pledged 90 percent of components to local suppliers and aims to achieve 80 percent localisation for its models from the start.In terms of powertrains, SAIC lacks a small diesel engine in its portfolio but Chaba indicated that the company is open to collaborations. “A diesel engine is relevant in certain segments, specially on the high-end side. We have a large capacity diesel – SAIC has got a 2-litre diesel engine that’s BS-VI ready in Maxus (its CV brand). But if we need to outsource a (smaller capacity) diesel engine, we would not shy away from that and we would tap into the best source,” Chaba said. However, he expressed uncertainty about the long-term prospects of diesel in the country.The India-bound MG SUV is likely to come with a Fiat-sourced 1.5-litre diesel engine and a 1.8-litre petrol with mild-hybrid tech. Although the share of diesels in India has reduced, they continue to account for a significant chunk of the demand, especially among SUVs. MG Motor plans to invest over Rs 5,000 crores over 5-6 years and double capacity to 200,000 units with upto 80,000 units in the first phase at an initial investment of Rs 2,000 crores.Electric vehicle strategyChaba confirmed MG Motor India will introduce an electric vehicle within five years of launching its first model in India. The brand will tap in to resources of its Chinese owner SAIC, which has advanced electric vehicle capability and has a large portfolio of electric cars under its Roewe brand.“I’m confident that we will definitely be at the forefront of electric vehicle technology in India and we are studying prospects of the same as we speak. We are also trying to test vehicles in the Indian road conditions,” he said.', 'New York: Do you want to stay attentive in your old age? If yes, then start doing meditation. A new study has found that regular and intensive sessions of meditation may help you stay focused and attentive even in advanced years. Anthony Zanesco of the University of Miami and lead author of the study said, “This study is the first to offer evidence that intensive and continued meditation practice is associated with enduring improvements in sustained attention and response inhibition.” Zanesco added,”Meditation has the potential to alter longitudinal trajectories of cognitive change across a person’s life.” The study evaluates the benefits that people gained after three months of full-time meditation training and whether these benefits are maintained seven years later.This research follows up on previous work by the same group of researchers at the University of California in 2011. The 2011 study assessed the cognitive abilities of a group of people who regularly meditated before and after they went on a three-month-long retreat.After the first group’s initial retreat was over, the second group received similar intensive training.As part of the study, follow-up assessments were conducted six months, 18 months and seven years after completion of the retreats. During the last appraisal, participants were asked to estimate how much time over the course of seven years they had spent meditating outside of formal retreat settings, such as through daily or non-intensive practice. The participants who had remained in the study all reported some form of continued meditation practice — 85 percent attended at least one meditation retreat and they practiced amounts on average that was comparable to an hour a day for seven years.The participants again completed assessments designed to measure their reaction time and ability to pay attention to a task.The study was published in the Journal of Cognitive Enhancement.(With IANS inputs)', 'New Delhi: Katrina Kaif and Alia Bhatt became BFFs of the tinsel town after bonding extremely well with each other during their gym sessions. The lovely ladies were often spotted hanging out together as they gave some serious friendship goals with each outing. However, if the latest buzz is to be believed, all doesn’t seem to be well between the two gorgeous divas. And it all started after Alia’s growing proximity with Katrina’s former boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor started making rounds. Ranbir and Alia are working together on Ayan Mukerji’s ‘Brahmastra’. The duo was recently in Bulgaria for the shoot where, as per reports, their closeness grabbed the eyeballs of each and every crew members on the sets. Also, Alia recently shared a photo with Ranbir on her Instagram account, that is alleged to have infuriated the ‘Jagga Jasoos’ actress.It is said that Katrina had come to know about the alleged brewing romance between the two by a close friend, who also happens to be one of the crew members of ‘Brahmastra’ and was present in Bulgaria. As expected, Katrina was extremely hurt and miffed with Alia. Recently, Katrina had attended a celeb-studded party, thrown by Ambanis in Mumbai and as per a Pinkvilla report, she appeared to be pretty low through out the event. On the other hand, Alia, who has returned back to Mumbai from Bulgari, skipped the event due to her shoulder injury. The report stated that Katrina has still not over with her relationship with the Kapoor lad. Pinkvilla quoted a saying that actress would have appreciated had Alia told her about her closeness with Ranbir. It is to be noted that Alia recently parted ways with long-time beau Sidharth Malhotra. The reports of their split surfaced after it was reported that Sidharth was increasing his closeness with ‘A Gentleman’ co-star Jacqueline Fernandes. ', 'Washington: Do we need to consider health risks when designing urban spaces? Yes, according to a study. Making neighbourhoods more walkable can have a positive impact on kids’ waist line and BMI (body mass index). Those are the findings of a Montreal research team led by INRS professor Tracie A. Barnett.According to the results of the study, urban design is a factor in the development of childhood obesity. The study suggests that infrastructure designed to encourage walking can help reduce childhood obesity.Pedestrian-friendly amenities, such as pedestrian crossing lights, wider sidewalks, and signs to help pedestrians cross the road, are thought to have a greater impact in high-density neighbourhoods. Such features can also encourage children to ride bicycles, play outside, and engage in similar activities, all of which help them burn off energy.The research team analyzed and compared data collected two years apart among children in Montreal with a family history of obesity and who lived at the same address for the duration of the follow-up.The study has been published in the journal Preventive Medicine.', 'An electrified version of the original Mini has been revealed at the New York motor show. Based on a late version of the first Mini that has been completely restored, the car’s original four-cylinder engine has been swapped for a pure electric powerplant. Mini said the finished car mixes “the brand’s unmistakable character whilst embracing zero local-emission technology”.That the show car comes one year before Mini launches its first series production electric model, which will be based on the three-door car, is no coincidence. As Mini engineers are working to move the car towards production, the brand’s marketing department is working to increase awareness of Mini’s upcoming model.The one-off Classic Mini Electric has been produced to show how the original city car recipe can be adapted to feature the very latest in drive technology. Mini boss Sebastian Mackensen recently told our sister publication Autocar UK that this tactic takes the brand back to its core values, making next year’s production car launch “pivotal” to its future.“We always joke and say if Issigonis was to invent the Mini today, it would definitely be an electric car,” said Mackensen. “It is the answer to current challenges, as the original Mini was in 1959.”The Mini Electric, first previewed by the Mini Electric concept of 2017, has been spotted testing on various occasions.', 'Sydney: While Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft largely preferred to talk about their individual role in the ball-tampering saga, David Warner, as he apologised on Saturday for his involvement in the row, did not hold sharing his views about the two…albeit briefly.The cricket fraternity was taken a back after Bancroft was caught changing the condition of the ball illegally during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town on March 24. Bancroft’s subsequent admission and Smith’s revelation of knowing about the plot drew a widespread criticism as Warner was said to be the instigator in the entire row. Warner, who arrived in Australia after Cricket Australia announced that he will face 12 months ban, addressed the media in teary-eyed press conference earlier on Saturday. While the former vice-captain admitted that he may never play for Australia ever again, he had a word of sympathy for Smith and Bancroft.When asked, “Did you realise how serious the crime was at the time?”, Warner said, “We know what the consequences are when you make horrible decisions like this. As I said, I’m extremely sorry for my part and my role that I played in this. And I really wish, and hope, that Steve and Cameron have the same support that I have with me, because it’s going to be a tough and emotional time these next 12 months.”There were reports that Warner had irked his teammates and they wanted him to be removed from the team hotel in the wake of the ball-tampering row. It was also learnt Warner, in his attempt to shield himself, had said that everyone knew about the plot, a suggestion which apparently did not go down too well with the pace-bowling spearhead Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and spinner Nathan Lyon.Warner, during Saturday’s media interaction was asked, “What’s your relationship like with Steve, Cameron, Mitchell Starc? Do you think any damage can be repaired?”Warner made it clear that they are “mates” before adding that he, Smith and Bancroft made an extremely regrettable decision.“We’re mates. We’ve grown up with each other. We’ve played on the field for a long time with each other. It’s going to be really tough not being able to partake in the next 12 months, not just with the rest of the team but with Steve and Cameron, because we made a decision that was inexcusable and extremely regrettable,” concluded Warner.', 'Kadapa: As many as four people were killed and nearly 30 injured after a sudden downpour and hailstorm hit Vontimitta village here in Kadapa district.The village, home to the famous Kodandarama Temple, saw sudden rains and hailstorm on Friday night. As part of Ram Navami celebrations, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and scores of devotees had gathered to witness ‘Srirama Kalyanam’ or the marriage ceremony of Lord Ram in the aforementioned temple. However, massive rain and hailstorms hampered the program.While shelters were in place for devotees attending the ceremony, the heavy downpour caused all shelters and temporary sheds to collapse, thus causing injuries to devotees, and consuming four lives.However, Kadapa Superintendent of Police (SP) confirmed that chief minister Naidu was not in the temple premises at the time of the mishap.Further details are awaited.', 'Mumbai: Actor Varun Dhawan has lent support to Australian skipper Steven Smith over the ball-tampering controversy and hopes that fans will “forgive” him for his actions.Smith, along with vice-captain David Warner, has been banned for a year for ball-tampering during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town. Cameron Bancroft, who was caught on camera trying to tamper the ball with a sandpaper, has been banned for nine months. Yesterday, a teary-eyed Smith made an appearance in front of Australian media after he reached Sydney, and said he regretted his actions.Varun took to Twitter and wrote, “Watching Steven Smith apologise and look broken is very sad. I’m sure the fans will forgive him.”“He looks beyond remorseful I hope and pray he will come out of this ordeal a better cricketer.

Fatima Goss Graves of the National Women’s Law Center, celebrated poet and activist, Robin Morgan and civil rights attorney Monica Ramirez are also going to be part of panel discussions at the event.The movement was formed January 1, after a massive sexual harassment scandal involving Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came into light.It aims to combat sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace, while boasting of a legal defense fund to help women protect themselves from sexual misconduct.The festival has also added a new Patti Smith documentary, titled “Horses: Patti Smith and Her Band”, to its lineup.Directed by Steven Sebring, the film showcases the final performance of Smith’s iconic Horses at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, as well as the 40th anniversary of the Horses album tour.', 'Ranbir Kapoor is 35 years old and unabashedly a mama’s boy. Or so the rumours go. His mom, a popular former star in her heydays, ironically has never approved of any of the actresses her darling son has dated. Strange, considering that Neetu was not exactly to the manner born. So it is hard to understand her inherent disdain for her son’s ex-girlfriends be it Deepika Padukone or Katrina Kaif. When  Ranbir was dating Deepika, Neetu constantly made snide references about how her son was not getting enough sleep and his girlfriend was not a good influence on him. “The first time he felt involved, I knew the girl was not right for him. I told him don’t get serious so soon, the more you see the more you know and learn, so meet many girls, and go out with them, but don’t commit yet,” was her refrain. Today that very same Deepika is India’s top female star. And now Neetu Kapoor even sent out a bouquet to the actress, saying “proud of you,” after watching Padmavaat. What exactly was she proud of? Official girlfriend number two Katrina Kaif assumed she had managed to get the Kapoor boy into her fold after they opted for a live in arrangement, much to mama Kapoor’s disappointment. All Neetu could do was talk about being “happy” for her son even as she plotted Kat’s exit from Ranbir’s life. Who can forget that famous X-Mas lunch at the late Shashi Kapoor’s house, after which Neetu conveniently cropped out Kat from a group picture. Following that, Neetu and Rishi did not attend the family lunch as they didn’t want to bump into Katrina there. This was also a strong message to Ranbir to choose his parents or his girlfriend. The rest is history. “Everyone has their own life. I cannot say anything,” was Neetu’s reaction after the news broke out about Ranbir-Kat break-up clearly dissociating herself from the story.Recently, she posted happy pictures with actress Alia Bhatt, who celebrated her birthday in Bulgaria, where she was shooting with Ranbir. Neetu appears to be fond of Alia. And when Alia posted a picture of her with Ranbir smartly captioning it, “And its just the beginning,” Neetu replied with heart emoticons on the post.\\nWhile there are strong rumours that Alia and Ranbir are dating, insiders insist that it’s not true. And now with reports out on how Ranbir still nurses a soft spot for Pakistani actress and single mom, Mahira Khan, his mum must be getting serious palpitations. “See, Neetu is a caring mother. Ranbir is a soft guy. He never wants to hurt anyone but ends up getting hurt most of the time. That’s the precise reason why Neetu wants him to be careful of the relationships he gets into. For instance, if she like Alia Bhatt and feels that the actress is also the kind of person that Ranbir can be with, she will be fine. Ranbir is a simple guy. Neetu is only scared of a high maintenance bahu in the family,” says a source.In August last year, Ranbir and his mother had gone off to London, apparently to meet a homely girl from a business family. While Mama Kapoor was convinced, Ranbir wanted time off to get a few blockbusters on the big screen before getting married. Guess this time he is having his way. Maybe he is trying hard to break away from her overbearing arms and Mahira maybe a step in that direction!', 'Moscow: Russia has successfully tested its latest intercontinental ballistic missile, the country’s military said on Friday. The Defence Ministry said the launch from Plesetsk in northwestern Russia tested the Sarmat missile’s performance in the initial stage of its flight.Sarmat is intended to replace the Soviet-designed Voyevoda, the world’s heaviest ICBM that is known as “Satan” in the West. Presenting Sarmat and an array of other nuclear weapons earlier this month, President Vladimir Putin said that they can’t be intercepted. Putin said that Sarmat weighs 200 metric tons and has a higher range than Satan, allowing it to fly over the North or the South Poles and strike targets anywhere in the world. He added that Sarmat can carry over 10-15 nuclear warheads, which are more powerful than the ones on Satan and it is capable of flying at supersonic speed.\\nThe Russian president also said the new ICBM accelerates faster than its predecessor, making it harder for the enemy to intercept in its most vulnerable phase after the launch. He also said Sarmat could carry an array of warheads capable of dodging missile defenses.', 'New Delhi: Rishabh Pant may have had modest returns from the Nidahas T20 Tri-series in Sri Lanka but his real gain has been an interaction with Indian team’s head coach Ravi Shastri, who gave him tips to work on specific skill sets ahead of the 11th edition of Indian Premier League.Pant had scores of 23 and 7 in the two T20 matches in Sri Lanka before being dropped and with Dinesh Karthik’s unforgettable 8-ball-29 in the final against Bangladesh, the young man from Rourkee has certainly slipped in the pecking order. “I am working on certain skills and also fitness with my coach Tarak Sinha (Sonnet coach). While returning from Sri Lanka, I had an interaction with Ravi Shastri. He told me to work on certain skills and I am trying to implement it in my game,” Pant told reporters on the sidelines of Delhi Daredevils’ training session.Asked about the specifics of his interaction with Shastri, Pant replied:”It’s between the coach and his player. I can’t disclose that. It was a good interaction. The atmosphere in the Indian dressing room is fantastic. I learnt a lot. Failures often teach you a lot and I believe I will comeback harder,” the 21-year-old said.He has played under Rahul Dravid (for U-19, India A and Delhi Daredevils), whose main focus with junior teams has been the “process” and now he will be under Australian legend Ricky Ponting’s tutelage.“Ricky sir gives you a lot of positive vibes. He is someone who always wants to win and same with our skipper Gautam Gambhir. I am expecting that things will change this season,” said the glovesman.However whether the coach is Dravid or Ponting, the execution of plan depends on the player.“The coaches can work on your mindset but it is the player, who has to give his hundred percent and execute it on the field.”While he had a good Mushtaq Ali T20 and Vijay Hazare Trophy for Delhi, Pant started the season on indifferent note during the Ranji Trophy, where he couldn’t repeat the 900 plus runs season like 2016-17.“I was in a good frame of mind but these things happen. You get a good ball, sometimes get out down the leg-side. It’s part and parcel of the game but you need to keep working hard.”He doesn’t feel the pressure now that Karthik has made the second wicketkeeper’s slot his own.“I don’t think there will be desperation to perform for this reason. And about pressure, it’s always there irrespective of whether it is Ranji Trophy, IPL or India.', 'Mysuru: Stepping into the home turf of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, BJP President Amit Shah on Friday told him that his “time” has come to an end and he would be mistaken if he thought that saffron ideology could be stalled by unleashing violence against BJP and RSS workers.Shah began his fourth round of visit to the poll-bound Karnataka with a tour of old Mysuru areas, asserting that Siddaramaiah and JDS would receive “biggest shock of their lives” from the region in the May 12 assembly polls. “It is said that the BJP is a bit weak here (Old Mysuru region), but after seeing the work of the party workers, I expect Siddaramaiahji and the JD(S) to get the biggest shock of their lives from this (Old) Mysuru region,” he told a party convention Mysuru.Shah is presently covering the districts of Mysuru, Chamarajanagara, Mandya and Ramanagara, where BJP had not won even a single seat in the previous election.The principal challenger to the ruling Congress is JDS in these districts.Referring to his gaffe at Davanagere earlier this week, Shah said though he had committed a mistake in his speech while referring to Siddaramaiah’s corruption, people of the state would not do the same because they knew Siddaramaiah’s rule well.“Siddaramaiah and Rahul Gandhi were very happy over my gaffe while speaking about Siddaramaiah’s corruption. I had made a mistake, but the people of Karnataka will not make it, because they have understood Siddaramaiah’s government very well,” he said.In a slip of the tongue at a press conference at Davangere while attacking the Siddaramaiah dispensation as the “most corrupt” one, Shah had said the Yeddyurappa government would get the number one award in corruption.He had, however, corrected himself after being prompted by BJP MP Prahlad Joshi, who was seated next to him.Shah also accused Siddaramaiah of playing with Karnataka’s pride by not celebrating the “jayanti” of noted Kannada poet Kuvempu or renowned engineer Sir M Vishveswaraiah.“Siddaramaiah only remembers to celebrate the jayanti of Tipu Sultan (the 18th-century ruler of Mysore) to get votes,” he said.Shah also met the Wadiyar royal family of Mysuru on Friday at their private palace, triggering peculations about their supporting or joining the BJP.According to sources, during the closed door meeting with the scion of royal family or the present titular Maharaja-Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar and Rajamata Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, Shah reportedly discussed various issues, including politics.Amid speculations in the media, Yaduveer, the 27th “King” of the Wadiyar dynasty, recently ruled out his political entry.“I have told several times that I’m not interested in  politics. There is no chance at all about me joining any  party. I’m not interested in politics. Through social work we  will continue our relationship with the public,” he said.Shah also said that his party, if voted to power, would make efforts to hunt down the killers of RSS and BJP workers in Karnataka, and hand out severest of punishment to them.“I would like to tell the people of the state that Siddaramaiah’s time has come to an end. Soon after BJP forms the next government under Yeddyurappa’s leadership, it will make all efforts to hunt down killers (of RSS and BJP workers) from any corner of the world,” he said.Shah was speaking to reporters after meeting the family of BJP worker Raju, who was hacked to death in March 2016.“They will be sent to jail and handed out stringent punishment,” he added.Shah said Siddaramaiah was mistaken if he and his government thought they could stall saffron ideology from spreading by unleashing violence against BJP and RSS workers.“In politics, there is no room for violence. If Siddaramaiah and his government think they can stall our ideology from spreading, then he is mistaken,” he said.Targeting the Karnataka chief minister, Shah in a tweet said there are multiple fronts on which CM Siddaramaiah has failed his own constituency. Mandya-Mysuru region has one of the highest farmer suicide rates in the state. Last year, there were more than 265 infant deaths in just 7 months in Mysuru district, he said.“Mysuru is just 140 Km away from the state capital, yet it has failed to attract any major investments. In 5 years, CM did nothing to fulfill his promise to widen Mysuru-Bengaluru roadway. It was PM Modi who fulfilled this long standing demand with a new 8-lane road,” Shah tweeted.    Continuing BJP’s bid to reach out to the prominent Lingayat community, Shah began his fourth leg of Karnataka visit by meeting it’s prominent pontiff at Suttur Mutt here.“Took blessings of Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji of Sri Suttur Math in Mysuru,” he tweeted after his meeting with the seer.The BJP president had begun his third leg of tour on March 26 by seeking blessings of 111-year old Sri Shivakumara Swami of Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumakuru, a revered seer of the Lingayat community.The meeting with the Lingayat seers is being seen as an attempt to reach out to the Lingayats/Veeshaivas, who are numerically and politically powerful in the state and form a major voter base for the BJP.The visit assumes significance as it comes in the backdrop of the Siddaramaiah government’s move to recommend to the Centre to accord a religious minority tag to Lingayats and Veerashaiva Lingayats in an attempt to wean away a section of them from the BJP.', 'Lahore: A woman, who was believed to have been murdered by her husband eight years ago, was arrested after she surfaced this week with her second husband and six children in Pakistan’s Punjab province.The woman, 30-year-old Asma Bibi, reappeared at her village Phalayan in Jhelum district, 250 kms from Lahore this week under a new name of Neelam. A family member of her first husband filed a complaint against her after which police arrested her.A Jhelum Police spokesman said Asma in 2009 had been married to Ibrar Ahmed. In 2010, she went missing and her mother had told police that her daughter had been murdered by Ibrar.Police registered a murder case against him under section 302 of Pakistan Penal Code and arrested him. He said the complainant later withdrew her complaint against Ibrar “after getting compensation money”.The police official said Asma had eloped with Nazeer Ahmed of her native village whom she had relations before marriage. She had a second marriage with Ahmed and left for Dubai where he worked. During the last eight years she gave birth to six children in Dubai, police said, adding the couple and their children have returned to Pakistan after Ahmed ended up jobless there.“We filed a case against Asma and her second husband under sections 494 and 420 of Pakistan Penal Code for contracting a second marriage without divorce from the first husband,” the police official said.Asma told police that her family had married her off to Ibrar against her will. “I loved Ahmed. As Ahmed got a job in Dubai we planned to settle there,” she said adding that she had no regrets eloping with her second husband.Saturday, Jhelum civil judge Sobia Khatoon accepted the bail application of Asma and ordered her to submit two surety bonds worth Rs 50,000 each.', 'Karachi: Pakistani authorities have arrested 52 Indian fishermen for allegedly straying into the country’s territorial waters, an official said on Saturday.The latest batch of Indian fishermen was arrested on Thursday night by the Pakistan Maritime Security Forces, he said. Eight fishing boats were also seized.A judicial magistrate sent the 52 Indian fishermen to judicial remand, the official said.They will be lodged in the Malir jail in Karachi, he said.Rajesh, 28, couldn’t stop crying as policemen lined up the fishermen to take them to the jail.“Most of us come from a village in Dandi near Gujarat coastal area and we didn’t know we had strayed into Pakistani territory while fishing at night,” he said.Another frail-looking middle-aged man being bundled into the vehicle kept on saying that the governments of both the countries need to do more for the poor fishermen who spend years in jail for no fault.Fishermen from both countries are frequently arrested for straying into each other’s territorial waters while fishing along the Sir Creek area of Gujarat in the Arabian sea.A constable guarding the Indian fishermen said that he felt sorry for them as they squatted on the floor in the heat waiting for the long ride to jail.On Friday, they were handed over to the Docks police station and then made to appear before a judicial magistrate who sent them to jail.These fishermen spend years in jail before any goodwill gesture on part of the government comes as a relief for them.The last batch of Indian fishermen arrested was on January 20 when 17 of them were sent to the Landhi jail.Since November, the number of Indian fishermen caught for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters has crossed 200.', 'Dhaka: A prominent Bangladeshi lawyer who fought the state’s case in a high-profile murder trial against Islamist extremists has disappeared, police said Sunday, with grave fears for his safety.Ratish Chandra Bhowmik, a respected prosecutor and champion of minority rights, has not been seen since he left his home in Rangpur early Friday morning. His disappearance comes a fortnight after seven terrorists from the Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh were sentenced to death for murdering the caretaker of a Sufi shrine in November 2015.Bhowmik led the case that saw nearly a dozen hardliners from the homegrown extremist group convicted for killing the caretaker because they considered him a heretic.Lawyers in the northern Bangladeshi city have staged protests calling for information about their colleague.“We are concerned and worried,” said Abdul Malek, a lawyer who represented the state with Bhowmik in the trial against the terrorists.Bhowmik, a Hindu and leading cultural activist, also lead the state’s prosecution against five JMB extremists sentenced to death for the murder of 66-year-old Japanese farmer Hoshi Kunio in 2015.Rangpur regional police chief Khandaker Golam Faruque said that Bhowmik had refused the offer of an armed escort during the high-profile trials.“There was no threat against him. His family filed a complaint about his disappearance on Friday night,” Faruque said.JMB regrouped after the execution of its founder and top leadership in 2007 and has been blamed for a wave of attacks on religious minorities, atheist bloggers and foreigners in recent years.In July 2016, suspected JMB terrorists stormed a Dhaka cafe and massacred 22 hostages, including 18 foreigners, in an assault claimed by the Islamic State group.Bangladesh has been waging a campaign against JMB and other homegrown terrorist outfits in the wake of the attacks.Security forces have shot dead more than 70 alleged terrorists in a crackdown since the cafe assault.Hundreds of suspected Islamists have also been arrested, and scores have been sentenced to death.', 'New Delhi: As the summer is fast approaching, people are losing their calm and obsessing over how to beat the summer stink.While excessive sweating causes embarrassment, it also adds to the challenge of self-hygiene. Excessive sweating, which is known as hyperhidrosis, could be caused due to stress, physical exercise, emotional excitement, diet, poor hygiene, hereditary hormonal imbalance, and soaring temperatures.It is important to know that sweat itself is virtually odourless, but when comes in contact with surface bacteria it produces peculiar smells, according to the beauty expert, Shahnaz Hussain.Here are some tips for preventing body odour:Be generous with the use of colognes. Colognes and Eau de Toilette constitute mainly water, or a mixture of alcohol and water, with only 2 to 5 percent perfume.\\nColognes can be added to bath water. Or, add eau de cologne to a mug of water and used as a last rinse. It has a cooling effect too.\\nBicarbonate of soda (baking soda) helps to prevent body odour, as well. Making a paste of baking soda and water and applying on the affected areas such as underarm, feet, arms, helps a lot to combat the smell.\\nPotato slices can also be rubbed on areas where odour forms easily.\\nAddition of one teaspoon alum to your bath water also helps. Crush some mint leaves and add them too.\\nRose water can always be added generously to bath water. It is a natural coolant and also a fragrant.\\nAdd 2 drops of tea tree oil to two tablespoons of water or rose water. Apply this under the arms with cotton wool.\\nTo remove odour from the hair, add the juice of a lemon and half a cup of rose water to a mug of water and use as a last rinse.', 'Hyderabad:\\xa0Petrol and diesel prices in the city touched a four-year high on Sunday.

Subsequent to that excise duty reduction, the Centre asked states to also lower VAT, but just four of them — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh — reduced rates while others didn’t.', 'CHANDIGARH: In the wake of Bharat Bandh on April 2, the CBSE Board examinations for class X and XII which were scheduled to be held on Monday have been postponed in Punjab. Several Dalit organisations have called for a Bharat Bandh on Monday against the amendment under the SC/ST Act. Following this, the Punjab government has declared closure of all educational institutions and suspension of mobile Internet services in the state.Punjab Chief Secretary Karan A Singh wrote to Secret Department of Defence, Government of India saying, “Army in Punjab to remain ready for any eventuality as state govt may need their assistance in maintaining law and order during bandh called by several Dalit organisations against the amendment of SC/ST Act.”As many as 4000 police personnel along with one company of Rapid Action Force will be deployed on Monday and strict action will be taken against those who indulge in violence. “4000 police personnel along with one company of Rapid Action Force to be deployed tomorrow. Strict action will be taken against those who indulge in violence,” Commissioner of Police, Ludhiana told ANI.The bandh has reportedly been called by the groups against dilution of Scheduled Castes-Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act provisions and alleged arbitrary arrests made under the same. The government has, however, made an appeal to the bodies to call off the Bharat Bandh.The Supreme Court had ruled that before filing any case of atrocities on members of SC and ST community, a probe by DSP-level officer would be mandatory. A prior permission would also be needed from senior officials before arresting any government official in such cases. The court had observed that many fake cases were filed under the Act. The decision was taken by the Supreme Court while hearing a petition filed by the Maharashtra government.', 'BAGHDAD: The mortal remains of the 39 Indians killed by ISIS in Iraq’s Mosul were on Sunday handed over to Indian authorities in Baghdad. The remains will be flown back to India on Monday.Indian Ambassador Pradeep Singh Rajpurohit said that the bodies had been taken to Baghdad International Airport and would be flown back on a military flight, arriving in India on Monday.Minister of State for External Affairs Vijay Kumar Singh, who has flown to Iraq, saluted the remains at the airport as workers loaded the caskets on the aircraft. Singh condemned terrorism and expressed his government’s stance in fighting it.“We are against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he told reporters, describing IS as “very cruel terrorist organization and our people have fallen to their bullets.”A group of Indian labourers, mostly from Punjab, Bihar and Himachal, was taken hostage by ISIS when it overran Iraq’s second largest city Mosul in 2014.The workers were trying to leave Mosul when they were intercepted and taken hostage by the ISIS fighters.One of the captured Indians, Harjit Masih from Gurdaspur, had managed to escape and claimed to have witnessed the massacre of the others.The Government of India (GoI) rejected his claim and maintained that all efforts were on to find the missing Indians and, without any credible information, the workers would be considered alive.The GoI had even asked Iraq for help in locating the missing Indians after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul from ISIS.The government in Iraq too had earlier expressed its inability to confirm if Indians taken hostage by the ISIS in Mosul three years ago were alive or dead.(With inputs from agencies)', \"A defunct Chinese space lab hurtled through Earth`s atmosphere on Monday, breaking up into piece as it headed towards a watery grave in the South Pacific.It re-entered the atmosphere around 00:15 GMT on Monday, China’s Manned Space Engineering Office said.Tiangong-1 was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments.It was part of China’s efforts to build a manned space station by 2022, but stopped working in March 2016.What do we know about where it came down?\\nThe rather vague “above the South Pacific” is the line from space officials.US specialists at the Joint Force Space Component Command said they had used orbit analysis technology to confirm Tiangong-1’s re-entry.Astronomer Jonathan McDowell, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, tweeted that it appeared to have come down north-west of Tahiti.NW of Tahiti – it managed to miss the 'spacecraft graveyard' which is further south! pic.twitter.com/Sj4e42O7Dc— Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) April 2, 2018Experts had struggled to predict exactly where the lab would make its re-entry – and China’s space agency wrongly suggested it would be off Sao Paulo, Brazil, shortly before the moment came.The European Space Agency said in advance that Tiangong-1 would probably break up over water, which covers much of the Earth’s surface.It stressed that the chances of anyone being hit by debris from the module were “10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning”.It’s not clear how much of the debris reached the Earth’s surface intact.Why did the space lab fall like this?\\nIdeally, the 10m (32ft)-long Tiangong module would have been taken out of orbit in a planned manner.Traditionally, thrusters are fired on large vehicles to drive them towards a remote zone over the Southern Ocean.

The encounters, which have now concluded, also left three Army jawans and four civilians dead.A terrorist has been caught alive, reported news agency ANI. Mobile Internet services have been suspended in the Kashmir Valley following encounters at Anantnag, Shopian’s Dragad and Kachdoor.“The Encounters have concluded. Two more terrorist bodies have been recovered from Shopian encounter site. In all 12 terrorists have been neutralised, three soldiers have been martyred and one terrorist has been caught alive. It’s unfortunate that stone pelting incidents around encounter site cost four civilian deaths,” said SP Vaid, DGP J&K.The three Army personnel who lost their lives in Anantnag and Shopian encounters have been identified as Gunner Arvinder Kumar, Gunner Nilesh Singh and Sepoy Hetram.Among the terrorists killed, Rayees Ahmad Thoker and Ishfaq Ahmad Malik are the ones who shot dead Indian Army officer Lt. Ummer Fayyaz in May 2017. The other terrorists include Nazim Dar, Adil Thoker, Ubaid Malla, Yawar Ahmad Yatoo and Zubair Ahmad Turay.At a hurriedly called joint press conference of Army, police and CRPF, J&K Police chief SP Vaid said this was one of the biggest counter-offensives in recent times against terror groups operating in the Kashmir Valley.Briefing on the operation, an Army officer said, “There was a design to help the terrorists. But our operations won’t stop because of some people who are under the influence of anti-nationals.”He further said that incidents of stone pelting have gone up in recent times. “We will act against those stone pelters who try to help terrorists at encounter site by pelting stones on security forces,” said the Army.AK 43, AK 47 and rifles were also recovered.

Witnesses said the two men were hit by tank fire while collecting parsley in a field.Later, six other Palestinian demonstrators were shot dead by Israeli troops near the border between eastern Gaza Strip and Israel during violent confrontations, he said.March 30 marks Land Day, which commemorates the killing of six protesters by Israeli security forces during demonstrations over land confiscation in 1976.Palestinians erected five main camp areas along the Israel border for the protest, from Erez in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border in the south. The protest is scheduled to end on May 15.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations along the border fence.The IDF said troops were “firing towards the main instigators” to break up rioting that included the burning of tyres and the throwing of Molotov cocktails and stones at the fence.Hamas, the militant group which dominates the Gaza Strip, accused Israel of trying to intimidate Palestinians.The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the protest was a “deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation with Israel” and that “responsibility for any clashes lies solely with Hamas and other participating Palestinian organisations”.Meanwhile, Saeb Erekat, Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s Executive Committee, said the Israeli government had been preparing to attack unarmed Palestinians during their march on the Palestinian Land Day.', 'Mumbai: It was a packed house screening for renowned filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk” here.A 70 mm IMAX film screening of “Dunkirk” was held at 6 pm at Carnival Cinemas, IMAX, Wadala and a 35 mm film screening of “Interstellar” at 8.30pm at Carnival Liberty Cinema, Marine Lines, where Nolan took the centre stage, last evening. Nolan is in India to support filmmaker-archivist Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, founder of Film Heritage Foundation (FHF) in drawing attention to the importance of celluloid in the digital age through “Reframing the Future of Film” along with noted visual artiste Tacita Dean.The 47-year-old director first arrived for the screening of “Dunkirk” with his producer wife Emma Thomas and Tacita, where they were greeted in traditional style with tilak and garland.“We can’t wait for this day when we are going to watch after 26 years a film on 70mm. Isn’t it emotional? We are going to watch an original creation created by a creator, who is going to show us one of his most wonderful films. We are very delighted to be part of ‘Reframing the…’,” Shivendra said.Emma said Nolan always wanted to come to Indian with his film.“Thank you very much for having us here. We always wanted to come to India with a film and we are sorry we are late. We are excited to present the film here, the way Chris had intended,” Emma said.Nolan said he was grateful for the welcome that he has received in India.“I have been to India before for a brief period for ‘The Dark Knight’. It is very exciting to be back here spending bit more time and for this great event that we have been doing with Tacita and Shivendra about ‘Reframing the Future of Films’,” he said.The director said he was happy to screen “Dunkirk” in India.“…It is exciting for us to see Indian audience see the film this way. We are excited about helping Shivendra bring attention to the cause of celluloid and future of cinema. I hope you enjoy the film,” he said.Looking at the packed house, Shivendra, said, we want more 70mm films in India and requested Nolan to have a retrospective of his films.“Maybe sometime in the future…we could do that,” Nolan said.Later, they all arrived to equally enthusiastic audience for the screening of “Interstellar”.The director waved at the audience and thanked them for coming for the screening.“For us it is about the place of films in the future. And screenings like this are very very important in showing people movies the way they were shot, made and wanted it to be shown. ‘Interstellar’ was never shown like this and we are excited to show like this to all of you,” Nolan said.The trio – Nolan, Tacita Dean and Shivendra talked about “Reframing the Future of Film” at NCPA.', 'Mumbai: Megastar Amitabh Bachchan has voiced his concern over the medium of film losing its importance in the digital world.The 75-year-old actor, who met renowned filmmaker Christopher Nolan yesterday here to discuss about film preservation and restoration, said the cause deserves serious consideration and it is important that people from the film industry across the globe come together to save the medium. Nolan is in Indian on a three day trip along with visual artiste Tacita Dean to promote the cause of film preservation and restoration,“Prominent dignitaries from the world of cinema gathered here in round table to debate and ascertain the importance of film heritage and its preservation. The word film has suddenly lost its charm ; for there does not seem to be any need to shoot films on film. It’s all digital now.“It was known as the ‘film industry’, they were known as ‘film stars’. So in the complete absence of that medium and that product, it would be quite in order to call ourselves ‘robotic genes’ or words of similar sound — ‘digi act’ or ‘digi digi’– It would be an issue that would need consideration,” Bachchan wrote on his blog.The actor said celluloid film is the “original format” and it is necessary to bring it back into business.“It (film) had greater aesthetic value , and its preservation, an essentially for posterity of having an original , than one that has been manufactured digitally. Digital is a derivative of the original film print so how would you feel if a xerox copy of a Picasso were to be up at a museum for attention and appreciation. Film is the original, digital format is not and in time to come this format may retire too,” he added.Bachchan also shared few pictures from the round table event, which was attended by Shah Rukh Khan and Kamal Haasan among others.', 'Mumbai: Prominent Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz has made an announcement lately that she has retired from acting, thus putting an end to her cinematic career.Diaz recently reunited with her co-stars Selma Blair and Christina Applegate of the 2002 American comedy “The Sweetest Thing” for an interview with Entertainment Weekly to reminisce about the film, reported CNN.

I’m literally doing nothing.”After Applegate said she was semi-retired from acting to raise her children, Diaz responded, “I’m semi-retired, too, and I am actually retired, so I would love to see you ladies.”Diaz last appeared in the 2014 remake of musical “Annie,” in which she starred alongside Jamie Foxx.

After looking at Ranveer’s performance in Padmaavat, Salman has decided discretion was the better part of valour even if the hero is a Dabangg one. Earlier the makers — brothers Arbaaz and Salman Khan — were looking at the last week of December for the film’s release. But after realising that Simmba was being slotted for the week after Shah Rukh Khan’s Zero, they decided not to opt for that date and push the film ahead by a month. This decision makes sense for the makers, as they will be adjusting the shoot of two films — Bharat and Dabangg 3 directed by Ali Abbas Zafar and Prabhudheva respectively. Thus, ensuring that the shoot as well as the release can be phased out. Now, Dabangg 3 will release on Republic Day.', 'Kolkata: Kerala held their nerves to beat Bengal via penalty shootout as they clinched their sixth national football championships for the Santosh Trophy at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Sunday.Locked 2-2 after extra time, Kerala goalkeeper Mithun V put up a stellar show in the tie-breaker to help his side win 4-2. Ankit Mukherjee and Nabi Hussain Khan missed the first two penalty kicks for Bengal as Midhun V thwarted both their attempts.Tirthankar Sarkar and Sanchayan Samadder’s conversion did not help as Kerala scored through Rahul V Raj, Jithin Gopalan and Jestin George.For the final kick, Jiten Murmu took on the gloves but Seesan S shot past him to deliver Kerala their first Santosh Trophy since 2004-05.Kerala had beaten Punjab 3-2 with an extra time goal to win their earlier Santosh Trophy title in New Delhi in October 2004.Earlier Jithin MS gave Kerala a 19th minute lead before Bengal captain Jiten Murmu restored parity in the 68th minute.After the regulation time stalemate, Kerala once again went ahead in the extra time when Vibin Thomas found the net with his 117th minute header.Kerala had the numerical advantage in the last eight minutes when Rajon Burman was sent off in the 112th minute.But despite the odds, Tirthankar Sarkar scored late from a curling free kick in the 120+6th minute to take the game into the tie-breaker.However, it was a heartbreak for Bengal as they failed to defend their crown as the Satheevan Balan coached-side kept a clean record to clinch their sixth title.The hosts were on the attack straightaway as Sarkar had two free-kick chances from the left side of the area within the first six minutes.While the first one was duly cleared by the Kerala wall, left-back Sreerag G pulled off a goal-line clearance from a Monotosh Chakladar’s shot after goalkeeper Midhun V parried it away.It was Kerala who broke the deadlock against the run of play when Jithin Gopalan intercepted a ball in the centre of the park and found Seesan S close by. He then showed some great vision to release Jithin MS on the run.Bengal’s left-back Abhishek Mukherjee was off his position and with Sourav Dasgupta failing to track the winger, Jithin MS brought up his fifth goal of the tournament by slotting home through goalkeeper Ranajit Majumder’s gates.All attempts by Bengal forwards were thwarted by the southern side. Monotosh Chakladar attempted a header from a set-piece in the 25th minute but it was straight to Midhun.Skipper Murmu tried his luck after the half-hour mark from long range but the ball went over the bar.Bengal finally put their foot on the gas and scored when Chakladar headed down a long ball and substitute Rajon Barman broke through to feed the striker who found the back of the net with a delectable left-footer.Visibly tired, both teams slowed down in the last 30 minutes.In the 117th minute, Kerala took advantage of the extra man and Jestin George’s cross from the left was headed home by Thomas.However, Sarkar had other plans when he converted from a free-kick from 25 yards in the sixth minute of injury time, taking the game to a shootout.', 'London: Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino insisted he always trusted Dele Alli’s talent despite the England international’s struggles to meet his high standards this season.Alli doubled his tally for 2018 by scoring twice in four second-half minutes as Spurs beat Chelsea 3-1 on Sunday to end a 28-year wait for a Premier League win at Stamford Bridge. Defeat for the hosts all but ends Chelsea’s hopes of Champions League football next season as Spurs opened up an eight-point lead over their closest challengers for fourth place.“I’m very, very pleased for Dele,” said Pochettino. “It’s been a tough period for him, but I like his talent, his character. I’m so happy for him because he deserved it.”Alli was left out of both England’s recent friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy with Gareth Southgate suggesting his place in the starting XI at the World Cup was far from secure.“I’m sure people will still be disappointed with the way I played today,” said Alli, who celebrated his first goal provocatively in front of the Chelsea fans. “I don’t think I had to prove (anything) with the way I played today.”But after scoring 22 goals last season, Pochettino believes Alli has just become a victim of his own success so early in his career.“In the end, he’s a great talent, only 21 years old, and sometimes we lose the focus on that. He’s only 21. Sometimes the expectation is too much.”Spurs’ performance was even more impressive as they came from behind after a huge error from captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris gifted Alvaro Morata the opening goal.Christan Eriksen’s wonder strike levelled in first-half stoppage time, before Alli took centre stage to end a barren run by his standards with two smart finishes just after the hour mark.“When we were down against Chelsea, the team showed great quality and deserved the victory,” said Pochettino. “We are in a good place to achieve the top four, and to do that at the end of the season is the challenge.”Spurs could even afford the luxury of doing the damage without Harry Kane, who made his return from a three-week layoff with ankle ligament damage 16 minutes from time.Conte’s days numbered:Chelsea manager Antonio Conte’s days in charge look numbered as failure to make the top four is likely to seal the Italian’s fate no matter what comes of their run to the semi-finals of the FA Cup.“My task is to work, and I know that I and my staff work 24 hours a day for Chelsea,” said Conte.“Then the club has to take the decision. I am not worried about this.”Conte has consistently complained of his lack of input over transfer dealings this season and insisted he has got the most out of a squad that won the Premier League at a canter last season.“Yeah, I’m sure about this. We are working very well, very hard and the commitment of the players is top. Despite this if you stay in this position you must be a bit worried,” added Conte.Chelsea enjoyed most of the chances before the break, but needed Lloris’s help to open the scoring.Morata hadn’t scored in the Premier League since Boxing Day, but no one has scored more headed goals in the league this season and he was left with the easiest of tasks to nod into an empty net as Lloris flapped at Victor Moses’s cross.However, Chelsea couldn’t hold their lead until the break as in first-half stoppage time the ever dangerous Eriksen took aim from 25 yards and his fierce dipping effort clipped the bar on its way past Willy Caballero.Just after the hour mark Spurs then led when Alli brilliantly controlled Eric Dier’s long pass before slotting inside Caballero’s near post.Alli soon had a second as Spurs set the seal in a hugely symbolic win.Son Heung-min was twice denied by Caballero but Alli pounced on the pinball inside the Chelsea area before slotting into the bottom corner.', 'Kolkata: Dinesh Karthik on Sunday acknowledged that he has an onerous task of replacing a very successful Gautam Gambhir but asserted that he has it in him to steer Kolkata Knight Riders to at least the IPL Play-offs and get the best out of his side.KKR think tank chose not to retain two-time IPL winning skipper Gambhir and handed the reins of the team to the Tamil Nadu batsman, bought for Rs 7.4 crore. “What Gautam Gambhir has achieved for KKR is phenomenal. He’s left a benchmark,” Karthik said after joining his new team and on the sidelines of a their jersey launch.Under Gambhir, KKR twice emerged champions (2012, 2014) and also made the Play-offs thrice (2011, 2016 and 2017).Karthik has wealth of experience having played for as many as five different IPL franchisees — Royal Challengers Bangalore, Mumbai Indians, Kings XI Punjab, Delhi Daredevils and Gujarat Lions.“Being a leader of the team, the management will expect from me the same. I’m aware of the expectations. Yes, there would be pressure. As a captain, you’re expected to at least go to the playoffs, that’s the least anybody can expect. I think I’m at a stage where I can handle it and get the best out of the team,” he asserted.Karthik looked a transformed batsman in the Tri-nation final against Bangladesh in Colombo last month when his last-ball six sealed a nervy win for India.“It’s been close to 10 days now since that innings, things have moved on, people have moved on. We have a new bunch of boys. It was a great game as I’ve said. When we play Bangladesh, it’s a different kind of pressure. If you win, you are like ‘okay you’ve won’, but if you lose it’s like ‘wake up, what you doing’ types.“We had a good start, it dipped in the middle. I just had to hit boundaries when I got in. I was lucky on that day. We had a good season, and for us not win that game would not have been nice to end the series. It was a great feeling.”Karthik hinted that he might promote himself in the batting order when they open their IPL-11 campaign against Royal Challengers Bangalore at home.“Obviously I will bat at different position than what I did in the Indian game. IPL is about dealing with tricky situation, handling pressure. It’s just a week to go and I don’t think I will treat myself any differently. Everybody is here to do their best and I’m no different. Everybody has a role to play,” he said.While Karthik will be busy with his IPL assignment, his wife and India’s squash ace Dipika Pallikal is eyeing a second gold at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast.“One thing I’ve learnt from her is a lot of determination. She’s worked really hard especially for the CWG. Four years back she won gold in Glasgow. As a player, the most important thing is to be able to repeat it and be consistent. She’ worked really hard in the last four years to get a gold again. She’s already in Gold coast. It’s very important two weeks in her life,” he said.', 'Kolkata: Legendary all-rounder Jacques Kallis on Sunday said the recent ball-tampering scandal in South Africa was a “wake up” call for international cricket.“I think there has been a lot of media and a lot of talk over what has happened in the last few days. It’s probably taken up too much of everybody’s time,” the Kolkata Knight Riders head coach told reporters on the sidelines of their jersey and squad unveiling ahead of season 11 here. “It’s just made players all around the world aware that you have to be careful of what you do. So like I said, it’s going to be a big wake up call.”Cricket Australia banned Steven Smith and David Warner for one year while Camerom Bancroft was suspended for nine months after all three admitted to ball-tampering in the third Test.Smith and Warner have also been barred from playing in the IPL.“I do not wish to add too much into it but think it’s just been a wake up call for everyone in international cricket. We need to look after this game and make sure we play in the right spirit and the right way.”The KKR head coach however urged his team to play hard but in a fair manner.“What I will be pressing upon my players is that we play the game hard but we play fair. It’s pretty much how I would like to see KKR play and that’s how we have been playing in the past,” he added.', 'Walong (Arunachal Pradesh): Indian troops deployed along the disputed Sino-India border in the Himalayan range of the Arunachal sector have increased their patrolling at a tri-junction of India, China and Myanmar to prevent a repeat of a Doklam-like standoff.Top Army officials told news agency PTI that the tri-junction, located around 50 km from Walong, the easternmost town of India near the Tibet region, is extremely important for India to help it maintain its dominance in the nearby mountain passes and other areas. “After the Doklam standoff, we have increased our presence on India’s side of the tri-junction as it is very important for us from the strategic dimension,” a senior Army official said.He said Chinese troops did not enter the tri-junction too frequently but had developed a road infrastructure near the area which could be advantageous for the mobilisation of army personnel.Walong, situated on the bank of Lohit river, had witnessed the bravery of Indian troops against Chinese aggression during the 1962 war between the two countries.The deepening of military engagement between China and Myanmar was another reason for India ramping up its presence at the tri-junction with thick rainforests on the Himalayan ranges. The official said Myanmarese border guarding forces did not patrol the tri-junction.“After the tri-junction in Doklam in the Sikkim sector, this is the most important tri-junction along the Sino-India border,” he said.Troops of India and China were locked in a 73-day-long standoff in Doklam from June 16, 2017 after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. The face-off ended on August 28.The area in Doklam where China tried to construct a road is a disputed territory claimed by both China and Bhutan.India sent its troops to stop the Chinese construction activity, saying it could be a threat to its strategic interests in the region.Since the Doklam standoff, India has deployed more troops and increased patrolling along the borders with China in the Tibetan region.Another official said Indian troops have also enhanced their presence in all the areas in the Lohit Valley near the tri-junction.“There are 18 mountain passes in the region and we have been carrying out long-range patrols to all these passes regularly,” he said.He further said,” We have been carrying out war rehearsals regularly. You have to be in an offensive mode to remain in an advantageous position.”China has been laying new roads and improving its overall infrastructure along the nearly 4,000 km-long border with India.Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last month that China had undertaken the construction of helipads, sentry posts and trenches for its army personnel near Doklam.Sources said China has been keeping its troops in north Doklam and significantly ramping up its infrastructure in the disputed area.In January, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had said the time had come for India to shift its focus from its borders with Pakistan to the frontier with China, indicating the seriousness of the situation.', 'Hyderabad: A news presenter with a Telugu television channel V6, allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the fifth floor of her house at Hyderabad’s Moosapet, late on Sunday night.As per the suicide note, depression drove 36-year-old Radhika Reddy, to end her life, police said.

The policy is relaxed only for athletes requiring prescribed medication or nutritional supplements under the supervision of a medical practitioner.However, the CGF insists that athletes should take prior permissions, failing which can result in unspecified sanctions.A hearing will now take place in front of the CGF’s Federation Court, the organisation’s disciplinary body, to determine a possible punishment.Prior to the CGF meeting here, there was a feeling that the Indian contingent could be in trouble amid reports that its boxers possessed syringes in violation of the event’s ‘no needle policy’.CGF CEO David Grevemberg, in a press conference earlier in the day, said they had initiated an investigation into the matter but did not name India as the target of the probe.Grevemberg said the CGF was in talks with the concerned Commonwealth Games Association amid spiralling speculation that Indian boxers are the ones under the scanner in this case.The Games are due to start April 5 after an opening ceremony on April 4.“That CGA has now been summoned to engage in a meeting with our medical commission later today (Monday 2 April),” Grevemberg had said.The Indian contingent has been insistent that there has been no wrongdoing on its part.After claiming that the syringes found could have belonged to other teams who are staying in the same compound of the Games village, a top official on Monday confirmed that the recovery was indeed made from an Indian but denied any dope violation.“There has been no doping violation because the syringe had been used to inject multi-vitamins. The boxers have been tested and had there been a violation, we would have known by now,” a top official in the Indian contingent had told PTI.“We are now waiting for what the CGF decides.”The CGF CEO had said sanctions would be in order depending on the explanations put forth by the concerned unidentified Commonwealth Games Association.“The report (of the medical commission) will include the testimony of the concerned CGA and that will be put forward to our federation court for further deliberation to determine the appropriate sanction.”Games organising committee chairman Peter Beattie had insisted that the matter would be dealt with transparently.“There will be transparency and nothing will be covered up,” he had said.', 'New Delhi: An Indian Air Force’s cargo helicopter crashed near the Kedarnath temple after it collided with an iron girder near the helipad here.The MI-17 which was carrying equipment for the Army attempted to land at the helipad close to the holy temple when a part of the helicopter collided with the iron girder.

', 'New Delhi: At a time when soaring prices of petrol, diesel, CNG and PNG has sent household budget into a spin, oil companies provided relief to some extent by cutting prices of non-subsidised LPG cylinders by Rs 35.50.The price cut is the second in less than a month after a reduction in international pricing early March had led to a similar fall. The latest cut by oil companies, however, extends to commercial cylinders. A 19-kilo commercial cylinder will now cost Rs 54 less while a small 5-kilo cylinder has also received a cut of Rs 15.Subsidised LPG quotaEvery household in the country is entitled to have 12 LPG cylinders of 14.2 kg each at subsidised rates in a year. Any requirement beyond that is to be purchased at market price (non-subsidised LPG rates).3 crore new free LPG connections by March 2020Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in February had said that as many as 3 crore additional free cooking gas (LPG) connections will be given to poor households by March 2020 under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) scheme for which the government will have to bear an extra expense of Rs 4,800 crore.PMUY was launched in May 2016 with a target to give 5 crore LPG connections to poor women in three years out of which 3.36 crore connections have been given.Pradhan said the 5 crore connections were to be given by 2018-19 fiscal year end and total Budgetary allocation made was Rs 8,000 crore.Now, the scheme has been extended by one year and 3 crore more connections are to be given for which Rs 4,800 crore has been provided, he added.Under the scheme, the government provides a subsidy of Rs 1,600 to state-owned fuel retailers for every free LPG gas connection that they install in poor rural households. This subsidy is intended to cover the security fee for the cylinder and the fitting charges.

As it is, the 1.5-iDTEC engine is one of the most efficient units around, and with a CVT, it is likely to deliver big on economy, even in automatic guise. However, don’t expect this engine-gearbox combo to make its way to the current-gen City.The City is well into its life cycle, and Honda feels the time and investment required to engineer CVT into the car would not be justified by the volumes sold. In effect, the petrol-CVT will remain the only automatic version of the City. The next-gen City that comes in 2020, however, is more than likely to be offered with a CVT for the diesel engine. Honda officials have stated that they will study incorporating the CVT on to more models, and the next City will clearly be a prime contender.The company has already started testing an upgraded and BS-VI emission norms-compliant version of the 1.5 i-DTEC engine and has stated diesels will remain an integral part of its line-up.

The last memorable silent film to be showed at the Bollywood box office was Pushpak, which was also a South product directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao. It is possible that Bollywood shies away from making or participating in silent films. Even in the past, silent films have been a forte of regional industries such as the Bengali industry or even the marathi film industry, both in their infancy. In fact, Hindi actors, up until verbal language became a prominent part of Hindi films, no longer dabble in the genre.  Variations in their target audience and market risks are one of the contributing factors to why silent films don’t excite Bollywood, thinks Avinash Das, director of Anaarkali of Aarah. “Because they cater to a large scale market, Bollywood filmmakers find it risky to experiment. Cinema in languages other than Hindi has seen relatively greater experiments. Hindi films during the new wave movement of the 1970s and 1980s did experiment, but could not find sustainable box office returns, leading to even lesser enthusiasm for experimentation,” he says. But before we make presumptions about what keeps the industry from taking the risk, film critic Omar Qureshi shares what makes silent films an absolute delight to watch. “Silent movies have two ingredients that are a must — an incredibly taut script and dollops of humour interlaced with tearful emotion. The first to make a silent movie in the talkie era was Mel Brooks, who made a film called Silent Movie. And it ran for months on just humour and emotion. Pushpak has the same thread. And the classic formula for a good silent movie is there to be seen in all Charlie Chaplin movies — Gold Rush, The Great Dictator, Modern Times — classics packed with emotion,” he says.Another contributing factor is Bollywood’s dependence on verbal communication. “Moments of silence in Hindi cinema are subsumed by our songs. Not music, but songs,” begins film critic Mihir Pandya. “Unlike any other cinema industry, our popular Hindi cinema is deeply rooted in words. And considering the caste ridden society that is ours, which is so conscious about any kind of ‘touch’ and develops all its good and evil customs on it, this value of spoken word is not that difficult to understand,” he continues. Avinash adds that even with penetration from the West that influences a change, Bollywood is struggling to offer opportunities. “Over the recent years, as Hollywood penetrated the Indian market, Bollywood too seems to yearn for change but regional cinema beats it at experimenting. While Kannada cinema produces a film like Tithi, Marathi cinema produces one like Court,” he says. And once Bollywood recognises the scope of these experiments, they rush to monetise it. “As soon as a Marathi film like Sairat sees success, Hindi cinema hustles quickly to make space for producing Dhadak. The minute they see a Baahubali 1 garner success in the regional market, they put their money in the second one, and soon produce films on the same scale or a larger one. It just shows that Bollywood prefers to play it safe with their money and will only put it in when they are sure to get returns,” explains the director. At the same time, film critic Raja Sen doesn’t think it is an industry issue at all. “I don’t think this is a North versus South or Hindi film versus regional film issue at all. Once in a while, someone exceptional makes a silent film, and that experiment works. However, this in no way reflects on that film industry or its audience. It will always be a creative and commercial risk, and it will always be a difficult film to pull off,” he says. Nonetheless, the scene seems to be changing. “Filmmakers from Bombay are doing some excellent work with the silent medium in short film format,” points out Mihir. Consider Faraz Arif Ansari’s silent LGBTQ film Sisak, which won accolades at international film festivals. Omar looks forward to watching Mercury. “It’s a good thing that Mercury revisits the lost art of packing just the right combination of a silent film. As for Bollywood — guess once the talkies get their good scripts in order the silent ones can reappear too,” he says.', 'Sydney: Bans handed to Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft should be reduced, the Australian cricketers’ union said Tuesday, arguing the punishment was disproportionate to previous ball-tampering cases.Disgraced former captain Smith and his deputy Warner were suspended from international and domestic cricket for 12 months and Bancroft for nine months over a plot to alter the ball during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town. All three players have apologised and accepted responsibility in emotional press conferences after being kicked off the tour and returning home last week.Australian Cricketers’ Association (ACA) president Greg Dyer said “justice which is rushed can sometimes be very flawed”, referring to Cricket Australia (CA) handing out its punishment so soon after the incident.He urged a relaxation of the bans to allow the men to return to domestic action sooner, saying of the dozen or so previous cases the ACA had studied, the most severe punishment was a ban for two one-day internationals.“These proposed penalties are disproportionate relative to precedent,” he told a press conference.Dyer pointed to the International Cricket Council sanction, which suspended Smith for one Test and docked him his match fee after he admitted responsibility for the ball-tampering scandal.He also said the contrition expressed by players has been “extraordinary” and should be taken into account.A wave of sympathy for Smith, in particular, has been gathering pace since a heart-wrenching public apology on Thursday, in which he broke down in tears.“Their distressed faces have sent a message across the globe as effective as any sanctions could be. I think Australia cried with Steve Smith last Thursday, I certainly did,” said Dyer.“We consider that the players need to return to domestic cricket earlier and as part of their rehabilitation.”With the 2019 World Cup and an Ashes series in 2019, supporters of the players believe they need to be playing state cricket to be in the type of form that could warrant selection.All three men have until Thursday to inform Cricket Australia whether they accept their punishment or will opt for a hearing, as is their right.Dyer also said the “win-at-all-costs” culture of Australian cricket must be addressed by independent inquiry examining the game from top to bottom, reporting to both the ACA and CA.“Organisational culture comes from its leadership and it comes from the top. It cannot be grafted onto the bottom,” he said, as pressure grows for cricket’s top brass to also come under the spotlight.“Let us identify all the causes of the tipping point that occurred in Cape Town.”', 'Chennai: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming today said that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni would play a ‘more prominent’ role as a batsman in the upcoming IPL by batting ‘relatively high’ in the order . “MS will be relatively high. The time that we choose may depend on the match situation as well. He would definitely play a more prominent role as a batter,” Fleming said when asked about Dhoni’s probable batting position.“Ahead of him there are some good picks, Kedar Jadhav, Ambati Rayudu. Jadeja, Bravo, Harbhajan fits in there as well, Karn Sharma, they can all hit. So again, looking at our sides, there a lot of multi-skilled players. There is a lot of options there,” he added. Fleming harped on the team’s versatility and said there were a number of multi-skilled players.“One of the key things of the squad is the versatility.. combinations are important.. both Indian and overseas.”Fleming said they had not decided on the opening combination yet adding there were quite a number of players who could do the job.“We are not sure yet. It depends on the combination and conditions. We have got a number of options that have been pencilled down. Shorey, Faf, Watson, Rayudu, Billings, Vijay…We have got six of them. “Shorey is a top-order batsmen, Sam Billings has played a lot of top order stuff. The combination is not just for opening, for the rest of the side as well,” he added. The CSK head coach said he expected pacers Mark Wood, South Africa’s Lungi Ngidi to fill the role played by the likes of Ashish Nehra and Albie Morkel in the past. “(Mark) Wood and Ngidi has got good pace. We have Indian quality in Thakur. Our strong component is spinners. Wood has a got a nice skiddy trajectory and pace.” He heaped praise on veteran spinner Harbhajan Singh and said the Punjab cricketer would play a key role this season. “Excited to have Bhajji here. I have always rated him high. He will play a big part in the season. It will be different than bowling at the Wankhede (stadium). The bounce and top-spin he gets is more suited to the ground here.” Fleming also pointed out that Harbhajan had played some good knocks against the teams he has been involved in and said he even batted up the order in one of those. “Yeah, he (Bhajji) has been very annoying. He has played some good knocks against the teams I have been involved in. He has played some good knocks in IPL as well. It will be nice if he can recreate some of the form. He batted up the order in one of the games as well.” On the replacement for New Zealander Mitchell Santer, who is out due to injury, Fleming said there was no rush to do so. “That was almost a luxury position. We looked at versatile players and Santner was one of the form players. We haven’t rushed for the replacement. We need to be a bit smarter about whether we need a replacement. If things go well in the tournament, we might not name a replacement,” he added. To a question if CSK would use the yo-yo test for its players, Fleming said ‘no’ and added there were other things to get right. “The yo-yo test.. No. It is very much into personal fitness.”', 'New Delhi: The Congress on Monday criticised Union minister Gen VK Singh (retd) for his reported “insensitive” remark comparing the demand for compensation to the families of 39 Indians killed in Iraq to demanding “biscuits”, and said it was “heartless, shameful and reprehensible”.The minister, a former Army chief, was speaking to the media at the Amritsar airport, where he arrived by a special transport plane, accompanying the coffins of the Indians killed in Mosul after they went missing in 2014.“Ye biscuit baantne wala kaam nahi hai, ye admiyon ki zindagi ka sawal hai, a gayi baat samajh mein? Main abhi elaan kahan se karoon? Jeb mein koi pitaara thodi rakha hua hai (Giving compensation is not like distributing biscuits. It is the question of people who have been killed. Hope you get that. How do you expect me to announce now? I am not carrying carrying a chest full of money with me,)” General Singh snapped when asked about compensation. On jobs for relatives of the workers, the minister said “this is not a game of football.”\\nThe statement made by VK Singh drew criticism from the opposition.Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said Singh’s remark was like rubbing salt on the wounds of those dead.“39 Indians were killed in Mosul, Iraq, as Modi Government continuously misled the families and Nation. Minister, V.K. Singh is now rubbing ‘salt on the wounds’ by rubbishing the demands for compensation for the families as akin to demand for ‘biscuits’. Heartless, Shameful and Reprehensible!,” he wrote on Twitter.', 'New Delhi: A joint plea was on Monday moved by Union Minister Arun Jaitley and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to “settle” their over two year old litigation regarding alleged defamatory statements made against the BJP leader after the AAP supremo apologised for his remarks.The move by Kejriwal comes as no surprise as he has already apologised to several others, who had filed defamation suits and complaints against him. The joint application was mentioned before Justice Manmohan by advocates Manik Dogra and Anupam Srivastava, who appeared for Jaitley and Kejriwal, respectively.The court agreed to list the matter for hearing before the appropriate bench on Tuesday if no technical objection is raised by the registry.Jaitley had in December 2015 filed a Rs 10 crore defamation suit against Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders– Raghav Chadha, Kumar Vishwas, Sanjay Singh, Ashutosh and Deepak Bajpai.They had alleged financial irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) when Jaitley was its president.The BJP leader had denied all these allegations.He had also filed a separate Rs 10 crore defamation case against Kejriwal after his then lawyer, Ram Jethmalani, had used objectionable words against Jaitley during his cross-examination in the first suit.According to the joint application, apart from Kejriwal, other AAP leaders — Chadha, Singh, Ashutosh and Bajpai — have “unequivocally” apologised for their statements against Jaitley in connection with irregularities in DDCA.Vishwas has not yet tendered an apology and therefore, the proceedings shall continue against him. Kejriwal also apologised for Jethmalani’s use of objectionable words against Jaitley during his cross-examination.On February 20, Kejriwal had concluded his cross-examination of Jaitley in the first defamation suit.The proceedings in the cross-examination was termed by the high court as “malicious” and “a sheer mockery”.The cross-examination of Jaitley by Kejriwal, which had begun in March 2017, ended on February 20 after more than 300 questions were put to the union minister over around 11 days.The proceedings had also witnessed the high court raising serious objections against the manner in which questions were being put to the BJP leader.', 'Beijing: China on Monday imposed tariffs on 128 US imports worth $3 billion, including fruit and pork, retaliating for US duties on steel and aluminium that Beijing said “seriously infringed” Chinese interests.The move, which was decided by the customs tariff commission of the State Council, followed weeks of rhetoric that has raised fears of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. China’s commerce ministry on Monday called the reasoning behind US hike in tariff an “abuse” of World Trade Organisation (WTO) guidelines.The US measures “are directed only at a few countries, seriously violating the principle of non-discrimination as a cornerstone of the multilateral trading system, that seriously infringed the interests of the Chinese side,” said a statement on the commerce ministry website.Beijing had warned in March that it was considering the tariffs of 15 per cent and 25 per cent on a range of products that also include wine, nuts and aluminium scrap. They came into force on Monday, Xinhua said, citing a government statement.The levies are in response to tariffs of 10 per cent on aluminium and 25 per cent on steel that have also angered US allies. “We hope that the US can withdraw measures that violate WTO rules as soon as possible to put trade in the relevant products between China and the US back on a normal track,” the commerce ministry statement said.“Cooperation between China and the US, the world’s two largest economies, is the only correct choice.” The White House has unveiled plans to impose new tariffs on some $60 billion of Chinese imports over the “theft” of intellectual property.Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic official, told US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a phone call last month that the IP investigation violated international trade rules and Beijing was “ready to defend its naitonal interests”.', 'Islamabad: Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, on Monday returned to London after her first visit to Pakistan since she was shot in the head by Taliban militants for advocating girls’ education more than five years ago.Malala, 20, arrived in Islamabad on March 29, six years after she was shot by a gunman for campaigning for female education in 2012 in Pakistan’s Swat Valley. Local media footage showed a smiling Malala along with her parents at the airport in Islamabad to take a flight back to London after the four-day visit.The visit was kept highly secret and hardly anyone knew until she landed in Islamabad and was driven in security to a hotel.On her visit, she met Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi at the PM House where a ceremony was also organised in her honour.“I have been dreaming of returning to Pakistan for the past five years,” teary-eyed Malala had said.She also made an emotional visit to her hometown in Mingora area of Swat district where she lived, went to school and was attacked in 2012.“So much joy seeing my family home, visiting friends and putting my feet on this soil again,” she had tweeted about the visit, terming Swat as “The most beautiful place on earth to me.”Malala, who is currently studying at Oxford University, also said that she plans to return to Pakistan after completing her studies in Britain.The famed human rights activist was shot at by the Taliban gunman in December 2012 for her female education campaigning in the Swat Valley in northeastern Pakistan.Severely wounded, she was airlifted from one military hospital in Pakistan to another and later flown to the Great Britain for treatment.Post the attack, the Taliban released a statement saying that they would target Malala again if she survived.At age 17, Malala became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her education advocacy in 2014 when she shared the coveted honour with India’s social activist Kailash Satyarthi.Unable to return to Pakistan after her recovery, Malala moved to Britain, setting up the Malala Fund and supporting local education advocacy groups with a focus on Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, Syria and Kenya.Malala began her campaign aged just 11, when she started writing a blog for the BBC’s Urdu service in 2009 about life under the Taliban in Swat, where they were banning girls’ education.In 2007, the Islamist terrorists had taken over the area and imposed a brutal rule. Opponents were murdered, people were publicly flogged for supposed breaches of the sharia law, women were banned from going to market, and girls were stopped from going to school.The Taliban, who are opposed to the education of girls, have destroyed hundreds of schools in Pakistan.', 'Peschiera Del Garda, Italy: Robby Pepper can answer questions in Italian, English and German. Billed as Italy’s first robot concierge, the humanoid will be deployed all season at a hotel on lake Garda to help relieve staff of simple, repetitive questions.During one of Robby Pepper’s first shifts, Mihail Slanina, a guest from Moldova, congratulated the robot on his skills. “He’s like a real person, he’s really good,” she enthused. “He talks, he shook my hand.” Developed by Japan’s Softbank Robotics, Robby has been taught a list of questions such as the locations of spa, restaurants and opening hours, programmed by Italian company Jampaa. The summer tourist season will give Robby a crash course in unanticipated questions, apart from accents, which will help improve his knowledge, vocabulary and ability to answer.The use of such robots is growing in services sectors like tourism, where the scale of business can overwhelm staff with menial tasks. Most of the automatons serve mainly as novelties — humanoid versions of an Alexa or Siri meant to marvel customers. They represent an expansion in automation, but one that’s likely to be scaled up only when better AI is developed. The International Federation of Robotics, in Frankfurt, Germany, forecasts sales of such robots will grow between 20 percent and 25 per cent a year through 2020, from about 79,000 last year.', 'Srinagar: An Army jawans was killed and four others, including a lieutenant and a junior commissioned officer, were wounded in Pakistani firing and mortar shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir Kashmir’s in Poonch district on Tuesday.The Army said that the Pakistani troops resorted to heavy firing and mortar shelling on Indian forward posts in Krishna Ghati sector in Poonch’s Mendhar area on Tuesday morning.

The role of Pakistanis in trafficking drugs is believed to be alarmingly high, prompting Lt Gen Dhahi Khalfan – head of general security in Dubai – to issue a stern warning on Twitter. “The Pakistanis pose a serious threat to the Gulf communities for the drugs they bring with them to our countries,” he wrote in Arabic on Twitter, adding a photo of three Pakistanis and the drugs they were allegedly trafficking.يشكل الباكستانيون تهديدا خطيرا للمجتمعات الخليجية لما يجلبوه  من  مخدرات معهم إلى دولنا..يجب التشديد عليهم بإجراءات صارمة في المنافذ… pic.twitter.com/LTCj5OW98m— ضاحي خلفان تميم (@Dhahi_Khalfan) April 1, 2018Local media reports say that Lt Gen Khalfan has also urged people in Dubai not to employ Pakistanis, going to the extent of saying it is a ‘national duty to stop hiring them.’A website called uaeviral.com even quoted him as saying that while Indians are disciplined, Pakistanis coming into Dubai are prone to crime and smuggling.

Unable to withstand the harassment, he filed case against the usurers before Guduvanchery police on February 28. Again the duo demanded Sekar to settle the amount. On Monday when Sekar was taking rest in his residence two persons reached the place in two-wheeler and hurled petrol bombs at him. A cot and other material were damaged in the incident. Sekar suffered minor injuries.The Guduvanchery police registered a case. Cops are conducting investigation whether two persons were involved in the attack or not. The incident of hurling petrol bombs has been on the rise in the region. For the past six months, petrol bombs have been hurled in Kanchipuram district seven times.', 'With two big banner films to be out soon, debutant Ishaan Khatter is the most looked after faces in the industry for now.

If reports are to be believed, the badminton star went on to threaten the authorities that she wouldn’t be playing for the country if the issue about her dad’s accreditation is not sorted out. In her letter to the IOA, Saina Nehwal wrote, “I msgd u and tried to call u but u didn’t pick up the call but there is so much issue going on with my father .. if his accreditation is no cleared as an official I am not going to play the matches.” Perhaps fearing that she might pull out of the game, the authorities immediately sprung into action and gave in to her demands. The hooliganism on Saina Nehwal’s part did not go down well with a lot of Netizens who are questioning her act. “It seems ‘village’ accommodation is always difficult unless one is part of team as athlete, coach, manager, support staff. Outside accommodation seems to have been arranged. Now it looks @ioaindia has pulled off room in ‘village’ itself,” wrote one user, while another added, “So the arm twisting worked. Wah! Wah!” “That is a sad state of affairs. Gross indiscipline. Very unfortunate. Just a shame,” added another user. Users also went on to call it a ‘Childhish behaviour’ by Saina. “Its true. High time these yester years stars are disciplined. They can’t cry foul & hold Country to such tantrums,” wrote a Twitter user.Earlier, the Indian Olympic association had tweeted back to Saina and explained why her father was not granted access. “Dear @NSaina, Mr. Harvir Singh is an accredited Extra Official! As stated in the CDM Manual of Gold Coast 2018 CWG and repeatedly conveyed to BAI (Badminton Association of India), the payment for accreditation of Extra Official does not include bed in the Games Village,” wrote IOA along with a screenshot of the manual.The screenshot states “Training partners and personal coaches are not entitled to access the CGV (Commonwealth Games Village), or to use the Games Transport Network. CGAs (Commonwealth Games Athletes) may elect to facilitate access to the CGV through a CGA Guest Pass allocation. The ETO service charge for an extra Team Official is AUD 1,480” — which Saina has already mentioned that she paid. The rule book further states that “the service charge includes access to the CGV International and Residential zone, games time transport system, but does not include a travel grant or bed in the CGV.” Looks like Saina may not have been conveyed the specific rules by Badminton Association of India.The ‘political’ reason?Meanwhile, a Twitter user, Ashok Swain, presumed that there could be a political reason behind this and wrote: “P.V. Sindhu’s mother is allowed but Not Saina Nehwal’s Father to travel with the Indian contingent for 2018 CWG — Sindhu had dedicated her Korean Open victory for Emperor Modi on his Birthday, but Saina has not been that ‘smart’.”All is well that ends wellThe officials quickly jumped to resolve Saina’s problem. Tweeting a photo of Saina, her father, along with officials at CWG, the twitter handle of IOA wrote, “Accreditation resolved! Saina is all cheers now… ‘All is #Gold ?? that ends well’ #AllTheBest @NSaina for #GC2018 #CommonwealthGames Make us proud!”', 'Turin: Cristiano Ronaldo scored a record-breaking goal and a stunning overhead bicycle kick to bury Juventus 3-0 on Tuesday in a rematch of last year’s Champions League final.Ronaldo became the first player to score in 10 consecutive Champions League games after just as Real Madrid beat Juventus 3-0 in the first leg of the quarter-finals in Turin, but it was his second goal that everybody will remember. The Portuguese superstar surpassed himself with a breathtaking overhead hit from inside the box to help put holders Real Madrid closer to the semi-finals.“One of the most beautiful goals in the history of football,” said Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane.It took him only two minutes and 47 seconds to open the scoring in Turin, flicking in Isco’s cross.But the jeers of the home fans turned to applause and earned him a standing ovation after 64 minutes when Dani Carvajal crossed back into the area where Ronaldo connected with an outrageous bicycle kick.Ronaldo responded by putting his hand to his heart and giving a slight bow of gratitude to the crowd. “The applause for Cristiano says it all,” said Carvajal.“Cristiano does things sometimes that only he can do,” said Zidane. “It can be said that it is one of the most beautiful goals in the history of football.“It’s maybe not as beautiful as mine in Glasgow,” joked Zidane of his goal against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 that gave Real their ninth Champions League title.“I’m the coach but I’m also a football fan, when I see something like that … that’s why Ronaldo is different from others because he can do that kind of thing.“I’m happy for him and happy to have him on our team.”Ronaldo has been on a goalscoring streak of 19 goals in his last nine games for Real — 28 in 2018 — a feat which even Zidane has said makes him jealous.He has now scored 16 goals in his past 10 Champions League games — 14 goals this season and a double in last year’s final against Juventus.He holds the record for Champions League goals scored with 119.“The Juventus fans applauded Ronaldo but also for his team,” said Zidane. “It’s beautiful. You don’t see that everywhere.”‘Football is a show’Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri admitted he was amazed by his ability to change his style of play in his thirties to adapt to losing some of his once-searing pace.“I don’t know if Ronaldo’s goal is the best in football history, but it’s really an extraordinary goal, you can only congratulate him on what he’s doing at present,” said Allegri.“The applause is a beautiful lesson from the Juventus fans to the whole world, football is a show, when you have 22 or 30 high level players and you see a shot like this one it’s good to applaud.”The five-time world footballer of the year has now scored in his last six matches against veteran Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, netting nine in total.“We saw what Ronaldo is and always has been – a player of an extraordinary level who along with Leo Messi is achieving the greatest heights,” said Buffon.“This means they can be compared to Maradona and Pele for the way they ultimately are able to decide matches and trophies won by their teams.”“When you play against one of the best players in the world, like Cristiano Ronaldo, you need perfection, if you leave space he punishes you, and then he invented a goal that will remain in history. It’s a pity that he did it to us,” lamented defender Andrea Barzagli.‘Leave Earth, play Martians’:Not only was the world of football talking about Ronaldo’s goal, NBA star Lebron James published a photo on Instagram of the action and world MotoGP champion Marc Marquez, a Barcelona fan, tweeted: “Bufff what a great goal for CR7!!!”.“Cristiano Ronaldo can now leave the Earth and start playing against the Martians, he has done everything here!” tweeted the Real Madrid defender Alvaro Arbeloa.“Seen a lot of great goals in my time but that is absolutely breathtaking from Ronaldo,” said former England player Gary Lineker.“The opposing fans in the stadium applauding the great @cristiano after the bicycle kick and rightly so. Keeps on upping the ante – relentless!” tweeted Rio Ferdinand.There was also humour from English footballer Peter Crouch, who once scored a similar goal for Liverpool, who wrote on Twitter: “There is only a few of us who can do that.”', 'Hyderabad: It’s no secret that the elder of the Pathan brothers (Yusuf) has the ability to demolish any bowling line-up. But, with odds like age and fitness not in his favour, Yusuf’s ticket to the Indian team seems to be in the waiting list.However, Yusuf, 35, who last played for India six years ago, said he has not lost hope of donning the Indian Jersey, once again. “I am training and working hard on my batting & fitness skills. I know it’s a tough road ahead, but if you work hard you will achieve success. I am not in a mood to give up. I will keep fighting,” the explosive right-hand batsman told this newspaper. Yusuf, who had a seven-year stint with the Kolkata Knight Riders, has shifted base to Hyderabad in this season’s Indian Premier League with the Sunrisers.The Baroda allrounder said, “I am very positive about the new season and looking forward to be a part of the Sunrisers camp where I will get the guidance of legendary players like VVS Laxman, Tom Moody and (Muttiah) Muralitharan. It will be a great learning experience for me.”Speaking about the team, Yusuf said: “SRH have Manish (Pandey) and (Wriddhiman) Saha in the side, and it will be great advantage for us. My objective will be to strengthen the side’s firepower which already has important pillars like (Shikhar) Dhawan, Rashid Khan, Bhuvi (Bhuvneshwar Kumar).”Yusuf also recalled fond memories of playing in Hyderabad where he smacked an unbeaten 210 in the second innings to anchor West Zone’s record 536-run target chase in the Duleep Trophy final against the South Zone in 2010. “Hyderabad has always been one of my favourite venues. I love batting here. I still cherish those moments when we chased down 536. I am positive about a good batting show here. I have shifted from one champion side to another,” he said.Asked about his equation with Manish Pandey, with whom he played alongside in KKR, Yusuf said: “Manish and I share a good bond and understanding. We have spent a lot of time batting together in matches and also in the nets during our stint at KKR. So there should not be much of a problem.”\\nBeing an integral part of Kolkata Knight Riders for seven years was a great experience “but my current team is SRH. My focus will only be on how to win matches for my side and play some ruthless cricket,” Yusuf said adding: “Wearing the Orange Jersey and being a part of this army will be a proud moment for me. The logo of SRH is on the left side and will be close to my heart, which in itself is a great moment. I have always believed that teams will keep changing, especially in a league like IPL but as a sportsperson my job is to do the best for my current side.”\\nYusuf was also all praise for his ex-captain Gautam Gambhir, under whom he played some important knocks for the Kolkata side. “Gautam is really a fantastic and an aggressive leader. I really appreciate that even when I was struggling, he backed me. When your captain is positive and fierce, he can always extract the best out of you and that is what Gautam is capable of.”\\n“In many matches, he did not perform as an individual or our side posted a low total, but his positive attitude helped us sail through,” the Baroda allrounder added.\\nWhen asked about his younger brother Irfan, who did find any buyer in this year’s IPL auction, Yusuf said: “It was disheartening that he (Irfan) did not bag a contract. Irfan is a sport, he took this positively.”', 'Dhaka: As Bangladesh gears up for the general elections to be held in December 2018, the Islamic forces in the country have started gaining ground.The Khalida Zia-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamic fundamentalist groups, are making attempts to root out the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League. Experts believe that the Jamaat-e-Islami has committed war crimes during the 1971 Liberation War and killed three million people in the name of Islam.Around 500,000 women were reportedly violated by the Pakistan Army and their collaborators.Shahriar Kabir, a Dhaka-based journalist and human rights activist, said, “The rise of Islamic militancy, terrorism in the name of Islam, perpetrated by the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Hifazat-e-Islam, is backed by the BNP, one of the largest political parties of Bangladesh. Because of the BNP, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Hifazat-e-Islam as well as other fundamentalist and extremist groups have become so violent and we have seen their violence starting from February 2013.”Experts sitting offshore are also concerned over the growing alliance of the BNP and Islamic fundamentalists as they believe the perpetrators of 1971 are still stronger than pro-liberation forces.Rohan Gunaratna, an expert on international terrorism based in Singapore said, “The Jamaat-e-Islami ideology has formed the sea bed, the foundation for the emergence of extremist and terrorist groups in Bangladesh. If not for the Jamaat-e-Islami, so many people would not have been radicalised and we have seen the emergence of JMB (Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh), HuJI-B, the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami Bangladesh and a number of other groups.”The rise of Islamic forces in Bangladesh not only affects the common people in the country, but also raises concerns for the fragile neighbourhood.BNP-Jamaat-led coalition governments in the past had provided shelter, funds and training to secessionist insurgent groups of north eastern India.A BNP return to power would mean New Delhi facing a hostile government in Dhaka as it would again allow anti-India groups to gain ground on Bangladesh soil.', 'San Bruno: A woman opened fire with a handgun at YouTube’s headquarters near San Francisco on Tuesday, wounding three people before shooting herself dead as employees of the Silicon Valley tech company fled into the surrounding streets, authorities said.Police did not identify the suspect or say what might have motivated the shooting at YouTube, a video-sharing service owned by Alphabet Inc’s Google which employs nearly 2,000 people at the San Bruno, California offices. The woman approached an outdoor patio and dining courtyard on the campus around lunchtime and began to fire before entering the building, police said.The San Jose Mercury News, citing a law enforcement source, said that she was targeting her boyfriend due to a domestic dispute.A US government security official told Reuters there was no known connection to terrorism.ABC News, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said the suspect was 35 to 40 years old, and lived in Southern California, with no apparent connection to YouTube.A YouTube product manager, Todd Sherman, described on Twitter hearing people running, first thinking it was an earthquake before he was told that a person had a gun.“At that point every new person I saw was a potential shooter. Someone else said that the person shot out the back doors and then shot themselves,” Sherman said in a tweet.“I looked down and saw blood drips on the floor and stairs. Peaked around for threats and then we headed downstairs and out the front,” Sherman said.The shooting was the latest in a string of mass killings carried out in the United States in recent years. Most recently, the massacre of 17 people at a Florida high school has led to calls for tighter restrictions on gun ownership.In a recording of a 911 call posted online by the Los Angeles Times, a dispatcher can be heard saying: “Shooter. Another party said they spotted someone with a gun. Suspect came from the back patio … Again we have a report of a subject with a gun. They heard seven or eight shots being fired.”Dozens of emergency vehicles quickly converged on the YouTube campus, and police could be seen on televised aerial video systematically frisking several employees leaving the area with their hands raised.One of the victims, a 36-year-old man, was listed in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital. A 32-year-old woman was listed in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman in fair condition. Authorities did not release names of the victims.The three patients taken to San Francisco General Hospital were all awake, Dr. Andre Campbell, a trauma surgeon at the hospital, said at a news conference. All three people were victims of gunshot wounds, Campbell said, but none of them had undergone surgery. A fourth person was taken to a local hospital with an ankle injury from fleeing the scene.YouTube Chief Executive Susan Wojcicki declined to comment to reporters as she left the building.“It’s with great sadness that I tell you – based on the latest information – four people were injured in this horrific act of violence,” Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in letter to employees that was posted on Twitter.“I know a lot of you are in shock right now. Over the coming days, we will continue to provide support to help everyone in our Google family heal from this unimaginable tragedy,” he added.In a separate tweet, Pichai said he and Wojcicki were “focused on supporting our employees & the @YouTube community through this difficult time together.”President Donald Trump said on Twitter that he had been briefed on the shooting.“Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved,” Trump tweeted. “Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.”In response, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey tweeted: “We can’t keep being reactive to this, thinking and praying it won’t happen again at our schools, jobs, or our community spots. It’s beyond time to evolve our policies.”Last month, YouTube announced it would ban content promoting the sale of guns and gun accessories as well as videos that teach how to make guns.Female mass shooters are rare. A recent Washington Post analysis shows only three out of 150 US shootings with more than four victims since 1966 were done by women. In 2015, a husband and wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California.', 'Johannesburg: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, prominent anti-apartheid activist and the ex-wife of Nelson Mandela, died in a hospital on Monday after a long illness, her family said Monday. She was 81.“She succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones,” the family said in a statement. Madikizela-Mandela was married to Mandela from 1958 to 1996. Mandela, who died in 2013, was imprisoned throughout most of their marriage and Madikizela-Mandela’s own activism against white minority rule led to her being imprisoned for months and placed under house arrest for years.“She kept the memory of her imprisoned husband Nelson Mandela alive during his years on Robben Island and helped give the struggle for justice in South Africa one of its most recognizable faces,” the family said.“She dedicated most of her adult life to the cause of the people and for this was known far and wide as the Mother Of The Nation,” it said.However, Madikizela-Mandela’s political activism was marred by her conviction in 1991 for kidnapping and assault, for which she was fined. She faced these allegations again during the 1997 hearings before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a panel that investigated apartheid-era crimes.As a parliamentarian after South Africa’s first all-race elections, she was convicted of fraud.Madikizela-Mandela had been in and out of the hospital since the beginning of 2018, according to her family. It said it will release details of her memorial and funeral services when they are finalised.', 'New Delhi: A Zimbabwean woman was caught at the Delhi airport for allegedly trying to smuggle out drugs worth around Rs 15 crore. Security officials said the woman was carrying about 3 kilograms which she was trying to smuggle to Manila in Philippines via Goa.Here’s how it unfolded. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials got a tip-off from the sleuths of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) about a foreign woman carrying drugs on Monday. On the same evening, Betty Rame, a Zimbabwe citizen, reached the departure terminal of the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport at around 8:30 to catch a flight to Goa. Just as she was about to enter the airport from Gate 3, a security official stopped her.CISF staff intercepted Betty Rame and took her for detailed frisking. She was made to give her baggage for checking. When the officers passed her suitcase through the X-BIS machine, officials spotted an image which looked suspicious. On lifting it, it seemed unusually heavy.The CISF staff then cut open the false cover to find a packet weighing about three kilograms. On closer inspection, they realised the packet contained popular party drug Methamphetamine also known as “ice”.“About 3 kilogrammes of Methamphetamine, a party drug also known as ‘ice’, was recovered from the bag of the woman who hails from Zimbabwe. She was handed over to the NCB,” a CISF official said.The woman has been handed over to the Narcotics Control Bureau in Delhi for further questioning.The CISF said Betty Rame took the drugs from an African peddler in Delhi. She reached Mumbai from Zimbabwe on March 20 and had visited India earlier in November last year.Methamphetamine or “Meth” is prepared from another drug called ephedrine which has a huge demand in India and abroad.(With inputs from PTI)', 'New Delhi:\\xa0In a snub to information and broadcasting minister, Smriti Irani, after a \\xa0controversial “fake news” directive, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped in and ordered the withdrawal of the order.The I&B minister’s order to take stringent measures against the journalists including cancellation of their accreditation if they were found generating “fake news” created a major uproar \\xa0in the media.The Opposition parties including Congress also slammed the government for its attempt to “scare and gag” the media.However, hours after the controversial directive by the I&B ministry the PMO stepped in with a view towards damage control and called for its immediate rollback. “PM has directed that the press release regarding fake news be withdrawn and the matter should only be addressed by the Press Council of India,” top PMO sources said.The Prime Minister was also of the view that the government should not interfere in the matter, sources added.It is understood that the Prime Minister has asked ministry to let issues related to the media be dealt with by the Press Council of India.The I&B minister was further embarrassed as the withdrawal decision by the Prime Minister came at a time when Ms Irani was asking for suggestions on Twitter to fight the menace of “fake news” to apparently uphold ethical journalism.', 'NEW DELHI: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met his Andhra Pradesh counterpart N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday at the Andhra Bhawan. The meeting between the two chief ministers began around 9 am. TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu had arrived on a two-day visit to the national capital on Monday and met several leaders from different parties at Parliament’s Central Hall on Tuesday towards securing a Special Category Status (SCS) for Andhra Pradesh.The list of party members that Naidu met in the Parliament’s Central Hall are – Sharad Pawar (NCP), Farooq Abdullah (J&K NC), Saugata Roy (TMC), Supriya Sule (NCP), Jyotiraditya Scindia (Congress), Jitender Reddy (TRS), M Veerappa Moily (Congress) and Rajiv Satav (Congress).He also met Anupriya Patel (Apna Dal), Harsimrat Kaur Badal (Shiromani Akali Dal) and Tariq Anwar (NCP).According to the reports, Naidu also sought support for the no-confidence motion against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. The no-confidence motion has been moved by Telugu Desam Party. “The Chief Minister is meeting key leaders in Parliament to send across a message to the country that not only making commitments, but honouring it also is very important,” TDP lawmaker TG Venkatesh had told reporters after the meeting.Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MPs continued to protest outside the Parliament building, demanding Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh. Naidu had last month asked his party’s MPs to continue ‘fight against injustice’ in Parliament.“All the TDP MPs must be present in the Parliament. See that MPs of other parties also attend the House and that other parties also give notices of No Confidence Motion,” the Chief Minister told TDP lawmakers. He added that the support the TDP is getting from all the other parties “indicate the sympathy from all corners of the country for the state, for the injustice, it is facing”. “The MPs should continue with the same spirit. You have the support of 5 crores people of the state,” he added. The AP Chief Minister also wrote a letter to BJP president Amit Shah in which he said the ruling party at the Centre appears insensitive to the aspirations of people of the state. Last month, the Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP pulled itself out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) last month over the special status issue. The TDP tabled a no-confidence motion against the Modi government over its refusal to grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh and also issued a whip to its MPs, directing them to attend the Parliament till the end of the Budget session.(With ANI inputs)', 'New Delhi: The Centre has given the green signal for the construction of 14, 460 bunkers at a cost of Rs 415.73 crore to shield civilians in Jammu and Kashmir from Pakistani shelling.Pakistan has repeatedly violated ceasefire in the state and in 2018 alone, there have been over 650 such instances of firing or shelling from across the LoC. While the Indian Army ensures a befitting reply is given each time, civilians have borne the brunt of the collateral damage. It is because of this that the state-owned NBCC has been given the go-ahead to construct protective bunkers. “NBCC has received sanction from Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India, for the Construction of 14,460 bunkers in villages along the Indo-Pak Border in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) amounting Rs 415.73 crore (approx),” the company said in a BSE filing, according to news agency PTI.It is expected that the number of civilian casualties can be brought down significantly by constructing bunkers – an urgent requirement considering the figures of 2017. According to some non-governmental reports, over 55 civilian deaths – either due to cross-border terrorism or cross-border shelling – occurred in J&K in 2017 alone.Construction of bunkers to protect civilians then can help in reducing tragic deaths.', 'It is probably the most printed book in the history of the world, but the Bible can no longer be sold publicly in China. Media reports say the Christian holy book has been deleted from various online book stores and e-commerce sites. The crackdown comes even as Beijing says it is trying to make talks with the Vatican work.In true Beijing style, there has been no public or direct order from the Chinese government banning the sale of the Bible. However, e-commerce giants like JD.com, Amazon.cn, Dang Dang and Taobao turned up no search results for the Bible, reported the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.The apparent crackdown on the sale of the Bible comes as the Vatican and Beijing hold talks to reach a deal to appoint bishops for dioceses in China. When it seized control of the country in 1949, the Communist Party of China (CPC) expelled both Catholic and Protestant missionaries, terming them agents of imperialism. The practice of Christianity in China since 1951 has only been allowed through churches approved by the government’s Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, which does not recognise the Vatican as its religious authority.For years, the Chinese government has categorised the Bible as a publication for ‘internal distribution’ only. That is Beijing officialese for book that can only be sold by government-approved churches. But this has so far not been enforced too rigidly.A publishing house owner in Beijing told South China Morning Post that an official of the Ministry of Culture had said the store could no longer sell ‘foreign’ books.Dong Jianlin, a bishop of an ‘approved’ house church in Xian told the Post that the news of the ‘Bible ban’ has shocked believers. “But I think the shock will die down gradually, because you just can’t ban the Bible,” he said. “People will always find ways to buy it, such as at state-sanctioned churches.”Ying, however, told the Post he believed the move was part of Beijing’s attempts to stem the spread of Christianity online. Officially, there are about 44 million Christians in China. However, along with ‘underground’ Christians, this figure may be more than the 90 million members of the Communist Party of China, which could explain the CPC’s edginess.', 'Washington: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday sought another chance for himself to lead the social media giant despite acknowledging mistakes that his company made in sharing its users’ information with a third-party. Embroiled in a massive data breach following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook had on Tuesday said data on about 87 million people mostly in the US may have been improperly shared with London-based political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook in 2004, once again admitted the lapses and asked for another chance to lead the company. “Give me another chance,” he told reporters during a conference call when asked if he is still the best person to lead the company.“This a huge mistake. It’s my mistake,” Zuckerberg said, taking the blame for the massive data breach. “Yes. People make mistakes and learn along the way. I’m the first to admit we didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibilities are…What people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes,” he said.He said he was unaware of the board asking him to step down against the backdrop of the data breach scandal. “Not that I am aware of…Nobody has been fired because of this scandal,” he said when asked if the board has asked him to step down in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.“I have not, due to the CA situation, yet. We’re still working through this. At the end of the day, this is my responsibility. There have been a bunch of questions about that. I started this place, I run it, I’m responsible for what happens here,” he told reporters.“I’m not looking to throw anyone else under the bus for mistakes we made here,” he said.Zuckerberg said the scandal has not much dented into its business. “I don’t think there’s been any meaningful impact that we’ve observed. But, look, it’s not good … It still speaks to people feeling like this was a massive breach of trust and that we have a lot of work to do to repair that,” he said, seeking to downplay the crisis that followed the data breach.Responding to a question, Zuckerberg said it will take years for Facebook to fix the problem. “It will be a multi-year process to combat disinformation,” he said, adding that this will be a “never-ending battle.”“I’m confident we’re making progress against these adversaries but they’re very sophisticated. We can’t expect to fully solve a problem like this,” Zuckerberg said.Zuckerberg, who co-founded the company in 2014, is scheduled to testify before a Congressional committee on data breach next week. “This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online. We appreciate Mr Zuckerberg’s willingness to testify before the committee, and we look forward to him answering our questions,” said committee Chairman Congressman Greg Walden, and the Ranking Member Frank Pallone. ', 'Jodhpur:  A Jodhpur court will pronounce its verdict in the 1998 black buck poaching case against actor Salman Khan and others, on Thursday. Final arguments of the case were completed in the trial court on March 28, after which Chief Judicial Magistrate Dev Kumar Khatri had reserved the judgment.All actors, including Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Tabu Sonali Bendre and Neelam, will be present in the court for the pronouncement of the verdict.Salman Khan, 52, had boarded a chartered plane from the Mumbai airport for Jodhpur on Wednesday, after landing from Abu Dhabi, where he went for the shooting for “Race 3″, sources close to the actor said.Bendre, Saif Ali Khan and Tabu also left for Jodhpur from Mumbai.Salman Khan was accused of killing two blackbucks in Bhagoda ki Dhani in Kankani village near Jodhpur on the intervening night of 1-2 October, 1998, during the shooting of Hum Saath Saath Hain.Salman Khan is facing charges under Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the other actors have been charged under Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code.All of them were in a Gypsy car that night, with Salman Khan in the driving seat. He, on spotting a herd of black bucks, shot at and killed two of them, Public Prosecutor Bhawani Singh Bhati had said.But on being spotted and chased, they fled from the spot leaving the dead animals there,” he said, adding that there was adequate evidence against them.Refuting these allegations, Salman Khan’s counsel H M Saraswat said there were several loopholes in the prosecution’s story and it had failed to prove its case beyond any doubt.The prosecution has failed to prove the allegations. It engaged in tampering and fabricating evidence and documents as well as roping in fake witnesses to prove its case,” he said.“It even failed to prove that the blackbucks were killed by gunshots. Hence, such investigation cannot be trusted,” Saraswat said.The case also involved two more accused, Dushyant Singh, who was allegedly accompanying the actors when the poaching took place, and Dinesh Gawre, said to be Salman Khan’s assistant.Gawre never appeared in court and was made to disappear by the main accused. Had he been around, there could have been more information available in the case,” Bhati claimed.', 'Bengaluru: A 27-year-old woman was allegedly burnt alive by her husband for not bearing a baby boy. The couple married seven years ago and have two daughters. The deceased has been identified as Veena, a resident of Koppa Gate in Anekal and the accused in Shashikumar. According to the police, Shashikumar was upset with his wife for bearing two daughters as he wanted a son.Over the last few years, after the birth of their second daughter, Shashikumar began harassing Veena. “Our daughter was complaining of harassment by Shashikumar over the last few years. But we ignored thinking that it was common between a husband and wife. We never thought it would take such an ugly turn,” said Veena’s parents.On the night of March 28, Shashikumar again had a fight with Veena over a male child. Following the fight, Shashikumar poured petrol on Veena and burnt her alive. Later, he concocted a story saying Veena was burnt in an accidental fire, the police said.The next day, Veena’s parents lodged a complaint at the Jigani police station, accusing Shashikumar of murdering their daughter. The police, who registered the case under Section 302 of IPC, arrested Shashikumar for questioning. During the interrogation, Shashikumar confessed to killing his wife for failing to bear a male child.', 'New Delhi: Ovarian cancer is one the most common form of cancers found among women across the globe. It takes growth in the ovaries and takes full form when a tumour occurs in the ovary’s cells. The disease is also known as ‘silent cancer’ because it does not show any symptom for a long time.Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until the disease spreads within the pelvis and stomach. The deadly disease is more difficult to treat and can be fatal if detected at the last stage.Since ovarian cancer rarely shows any symptoms in early stages, it often goes undected until it reaches an advanced stage. The disease can affect women of any age, however, it is most frequently diagnosed in postmenopausal women.The most common signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are:Abdominal bloating or swelling\\nConstipation\\nPersistent pelvic and abdominal pain\\nDifficulty eating and quickly feeling full when eating\\nNausea\\nWeight loss\\nA frequent need to urinate\\nMenstrual changes\\nPainful intercourseBut, one can reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer by simply making healthy choices like- proper physical activity and eating a healthy diet.Blueberry\\nThe fruit contains rich amount of antioxidants that help to prevent the development of many forms of cancer.

Suri’s film, which stars his Aashiqui 2 actor Aditya Roy Kapoor and Akaash Vani actor Sunny Singh. If sources are to be believed Disha has been talking to Mohit for a while and is set to sign on the dotted line. “Disha has not signed many films and has rejected a lot more. There was a film where she was offered to play the lead opposite a relativly newcomer who is a damn good actor. But she asked for Tiger Shroff or Sushant Singh Rajput to be cast in the film,” says a source, adding, “She was being paid a bomb, but she still wanted a big star opposite her.”Incidentally the M.S.

When Kaifi saheb embarked on the journey alone, Mijwan (a village in Uttar Pradesh) did not even figure on the map of India. Today, Mijwan is known all over the world,” Azmi said in a statement here.PVR has joined hands with the NGO and would screen a 60-second-long video which narrates the inspiring story about Mijwan before the national anthem is played, a press release issued here said.Mijwan was launched with the goal of creating employment opportunities for the region’s women and reviving the art of chikankari embroidery.Celebrity fashion designer Manish Malhotra has also collaborated with Azmi to provide work to the Mijwan artisans.Bollywood A-listers such as Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and others have walked the ramp to support the cause of Mijwan in the past.', 'Gold Coast : The star-studded Indian Badminton team on Thursday defeated Sri Lanka in Group A of the mixed team championship, on Day 1 of the Commonwealth Games 2018.Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth won their respective singles matches, while the pairs of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and Ruthvika Gadde, Satwik Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, and Ashwini Ponnappa and N.

News agency ANI captured a video where Saif, amidst trying to avoid the media, blackmails his driver.“Sheesha upar karo aur reverse kar lo warna padegi ek abhi (pull the windows and take a reverse, otherwise you will get one),” Saif can be heard saying in the video.As expected, the video went viral instantly and the Nawab Saif Ali Khan Pataudi’s real face came in front of the people.Salman Khan, Tabu and Sonali Bendre Behl were also among those who had to appear in Jodhpur court for the verdict.They all worked together in ‘Hum Saath Saath Hai’, which is where the case started from.', 'Filmmaker Hansal Mehta’s Omerta, based on London-born terrorist Omar Saeed Sheikh’s life, is set to release by April 20. Omar Saeed is a controversial figure, and Hansal’s film has been generating buzz for broaching the subject. But the filmmaker reveals that he isn’t trying to create any communal tension with this film.“One has to see the maker and his intent. The intention is not to arouse communal tension with this film. If I made Omerta, I also made Shahid. I simply want to show the mirror to society. We cannot talk about peace and love with Pakistan while they continue to harbour people like Omar,” says Hansal. But he is quick to clarify, “The film isn’t discriminating to the Muslim population either. It does not say that every Muslim is a terrorist.”Omerta is shot in real locations across London and India. It is woven around some of the most bloody terror attacks, including the 9/11 attacks. Hansal and his lead actor Rajkummar Rao go back a long way. The director says he likes to take up challenging subjects with Rajkummar.“We constantly look for new challenges when it comes to making films. It feels great to challenge him because I know that he can pull any role,” he says.According to Hansal, Rajkummar has grown as an actor after Shahid. “It feels great to challenge him with different roles and you are assured he can pull it off with ease. After Shahid, I found my muse in him.

I am trying to put some very interesting content together from my production house,” says Dia. “I am producing and also acting in one of the web-series. I have got some interesting offers from other filmmakers as well and I am seriously considering it as it is great to see the way the stories are being told,” she adds.    Apart from being an actor, Dia has been appointed as the United Nations Environment Goodwill Ambassador for India. The 35-year-old actor was recognised by the UN for her contribution to environment conservation.Dia seems to have taken crucial steps especially when it comes to banning plastic. “You have to keep reminding the people who work with you why it’s important to follow such practices. When we speak of     plastic bags, straws, and cutlery, these are three items that we, as citizens, can absolutely get rid of,” says Dia. She further suggests alternatives that people can use instead.“They may not be as convenient, but if one considers the impact of plastic on the environment and our health, it should compel us to make wiser and responsible choices,” she advices.', 'Washington: The United States on Wednesday rejected as “baseless” China’s retaliatory tariffs and complaint in the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the US tariffs recently imposed on steel and aluminium imports.President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 15 per cent on aluminium early in March, citing national security concerns. But China invoked the WTO dispute process under a different rule, which does not apply, meaning Beijing’s threat of retaliatory tariffs on USD 3 billion in US exports is not justified, the US Trade Representative’s office said in a statement.“China’s request for consultations… is completely baseless” because the US tariffs “address the national security threat posed by imports of steel and aluminium” and are not part of a safeguard action, USTR said.A request for consultation is the first step in the WTO’s dispute settlement process.WTO allows temporary tariffs on imports — known as safeguards — as an emergency move when a flood of goods “threatens to cause serious injury” to domestic industry.But the global trade body also allows import restrictions based on national security concerns.“Consequently, there is no basis under WTO rules for China’s decision this week to raise tariffs against over USD 3 billion in US exports,” USTR said.But in a letter to China’s WTO representative, US Ambassador Dennis Shea said officials “stand ready to fix a mutually convenient date with China to engage in bilateral discussions.”Primarily intended to compensate for China’s overproduction, the US tariffs hit allies as well, prompting the Trump administration to exempt the European Union, Canada, Mexico and four other economies.Fears of an all-out trade war have intensified in the past month, especially in the wake of this week’s tit-for-tat tariffs announced by each country on USD 50 billion in imports from the other, including China’s hit list on soy, aircraft and autos.China has said imposing tariffs on national security grounds poses a systemic threat to the rules-based global trading system safeguarded by the 164-member WTO.The WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body has never arbitrated a case filed under its national security clause.The concern among WTO officials is that if a member-state, especially a world’s top economy, justifies protectionist measures based on national security, it would trigger a free-for-all, with nations ignoring all trading rules currently on the books.', 'Moscow: Russia on Wednesday accused British and US secret services of being behind the poisoning of a Russian former double agent as the world’s chemical weapons watchdog held a closed-door meeting on the incident at Moscow’s request.Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin in a speech in Moscow said the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a nerve agent was a “grotesque provocation… that was crudely concocted by the British and American security services” with the intention of implicating Russia. He also warned that Moscow and the West must avoid escalating their current standoff to the dangerous levels reached at the height of Cold War.British and Russian officials meanwhile faced off at a closed-door meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for the first time since the poisoning of the Skripals on March 4.The meeting in The Hague was held on Moscow’s request to discuss the Skripal poisoning while an inquiry is still ongoing.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that he hoped the meeting would draw a line under the incident but Britain’s foreign ministry called it a “diversionary tactic intended to undermine the work of the OPCW.”Russia’s ambassador to the Netherlands and deputy minister for industry and trade Georgy Kalamanov attended, along with British chemical weapons expert and acting permanent representative to OPCW John Foggo.A diplomatic source who asked not to be named told AFP that Russia had tabled a motion asking the OPCW to “involve Russia in some way or another in the investigation.”The OPCW’s experts have taken samples from the site in Salisbury and sent them to certified laboratories for analysis but are still awaiting the results.Under the rules of the Chemical Weapons Convention it is up to Britain to lead the inquiry, with technical assistance from the OPCW which is acting in a “totally independent manner,” the source said. New Iron Curtain Russia accused the West of wanting to put up a new Iron Curtain and warned of a return to the mutual isolation of the Cold War. For Washington, “fighting the non-existent so-called Russian threat has become a real fixation,” foreign intelligence chief Naryshkin said.“It has reached such proportions and developed such ludicrous characteristics, that it’s time to talk about the return of the grim times of the Cold War.”“Seized by fear of changes, the West is ready to put up a new Iron Curtain around itself,” he claimed in punchy rhetoric. He urged the need “to stop the use of force in relations between states, not to bring matters to a new Cuban Missile Crisis”.That was a reference to the 1962 standoff between the Soviet Union and the United States that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.Britain has said it is “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the attack on the Skripals but Moscow has angrily denied any involvement.British authorities say the Skripals were poisoned with the Soviet-designed nerve agent Novichok. The British defence laboratory analysing the nerve agent said Tuesday that it could not say whether it came from Russia. Moscow hailed that as a vindication of its repeated denials of involvement.The Kremlin has demanded an apology from British Prime Minister Theresa May and her government for implicating Putin in the attack, saying this “idiocy has gone too far.”', 'Islamabad: The latest list of terrorist and militant groups released by the UN Security Council features 139 entries from Pakistan alone. The list, headed by Osama bin Laden’s heir apparent Ayman al-Zawahiri, also includes Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed’s Lashkar-e-Taiba and Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar.The list identifies all those individuals who have lived in Pakistan, operated from there or have been associated with groups that used Pakistani territory for carrying out their operations, Dawn News reported. LeT’s Hafiz Saeed is listed as a person also wanted by Interpol for his involvement in terrorist activities. The LeT is responsible for carrying out the Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.According to the UN Security Council, Dawood has held several Pakistani passports issued in Rawalpindi and Karachi, the report said. The UN claims that he owns a palatial bungalow in the hilly area of Noorabad, Karachi, it added.Dawood, wanted in India as the mastermind of the Mumbai bomb blasts in 1993 and accused of crimes such as match-fixing and extortion, accrued a vast property portfolio across the Midlands and south-east in the UK as well as India, the UAE, Spain, Morocco, Turkey, Cyprus and Australia.Apart from them, Haji Mohammed Yahya Mujahid, LeT’s media contact, and Hafiz Saeed’s deputies, Abdul Salaam and Zafar Iqbal, are also listed. Like Hafiz Saeed, they are all wanted by the Interpol. The LeT is listed with its various aliases, such as al-Mansoorian, Paasban-i-Kashmir, Paasban-i-Ahle Hadith, Jamaatud Dawa and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, the report said.The UN data claims that first person on the list Ayman al-Zawahiri is still hiding somewhere in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, the report said. Several of his lieutenants are also on the list who, the UN believes, are hiding with him.The second person on the list is another internationally known terrorist, Ramzi Mohammad bin al-Sheibah, who is identified as a Yemeni national, arrested in Karachi and handed over to the US authorities. More than a dozen suspected terrorists are listed in the same category, arrested in Pakistan and handed over to the US authorities. Some of them had Pakistani passport, issued by various Pakistani missions in the Middle East and renewed in Pakistan.The report, however, did not give the total number of entries in the updated UNSC list.The terrorist entities that were allegedly based in Pakistan, worked from there or had links to Pakistani individuals, include Jaish-e-Mohammed, Afghan Support Committee, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Al Akhtar Trust International, Harkatul Jihad Islami, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Jamaatul Ahrar and Khatiba Imam Al-Bukhari. Some of them are listed as based in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, according to the report.', 'NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that its Aadhaar scheme has been approved by experts and was not open to judicial review as it was a policy decision.The government told a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra which is examining the validity of Aadhaar scheme and its enabling 2016 law that in a digital era, Aadhaar is the best way to prevent “money laundering and deliver subsidies and benefits”.“The policy decisions of the government approved by experts are not subject to judicial review,” Attorney General K K Venugopal told the bench which also comprised justices A K Sikri, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan.Venugopal, in his day-long arguments, also referred to various reports including that of World Bank and said that they acknowledged that India has taken a step to give an identity to the “poorest of poor”, which would finally help in achieving the task of financial inclusion of all.The top law officer said that that the development will slow down if there was judicial review of every state action and “courts should not interfere in matters of technical expertise”.The only duty of the court is to expound the language of the law and it may not decide whether a particular policy decision is fair or not, he said.The bench asked Venugopal that the people, opposed to the scheme, say that it violated the doctrine of proportionality.The Aadhaar scheme satisfies the test of proportionality by showing a rational nexus between the means and the goal, he said, adding that all subsidies were part of right to life with dignity and would prevail over the right to privacy.The State has a legitimate state interest in rolling out Aadhaar, he said.On the issue of 16-digit virtual Aadhaar ID, Venugopal said that it is an excellent safety measure.Is it the onus on the individual to generate and get a virtual ID, the bench then asked.As Venugopal replied in affirmative, the bench asked as to whether 1.2 billion citizens can do it and said the Aadhaar may pass the test of “legitimate State interest”, but the doctrine of proportionality has to be satisfied.The bench said “biological attributes” are open ended and the authorities may expand and include some more biometric features in the Aadhaar scheme in future and asked whether it would not amount to “excessive delegation of powers” by Parliament.Blood, urine, DNA may be added, but that will be be subject to examination by the courts, just like right now the court is examining whether collection of fingerprints and Iris scans are a violation of privacy, Venugopal said.The power of UIDAI to decide what is ‘biological attributes” and the method of collecting it has to meet the test of proportionality, the bench said.Venugopal said that Aadhaar has helped in curbing the leakages in the disbursal of benefits under welfare schemes.The legitimate State interest runs through the entire Aadhaar Act and it has helped in dissipation of subsides, prevention of black money and money laundering by linking it with bank accounts, he said.\\nHe referred to several judgements of the American Supreme Court which have upheld the fingerprint imaging for social security card.However, the bench observed that the position taken by the European courts including by the German court was diametrically different to the position taken by US courts.\\nWould it be better not to refer to foreign court judgements as they may cause confusion, the bench asked.The advancing of arguments remained inconclusive and would continue tomorrow.Earlier, the Centre had said that the Aadhaar Act was a “fair and reasonable law” which complied with the tests prescribed by the historic verdict on the right to privacy.The apex court had refused to pass an interim order extending the deadline of March 31 for linking of Aadhaar with the welfare schemes where benefits are transferred to citizens from the Consolidated Fund of India.The bench is hearing on clutch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Aadhaar and its enabling 2016 law.', 'NEW DELHI: American airline manufacturing giant Boeing has said it has clinched a binding, firm order for 75 of its 737 MAX aircraft from Jet Airways. This would make it the second order of this size for the aircraft that Jet has placed in as many years.The deal was estimated to cost Jet Airways between $7.2 billion and $9.7 billion, based on which variant of the 737 MAX that Jet has chosen to purchase, news agency Reuters reported. Unconfirmed reports and indications suggest the most recent order of 75 aircraft are for the 737 MAX 8 variant.The Indian carrier’s feet heavily relies on Boeing jets, with 60 percent being just 737-800 aircraft. SpiceJet too has placed a huge order of around 120 737 MAX aircraft. Both the Indian airliners are waiting for their first deliveries.The 737 MAX is a redesigned version of Boeing’s immensely popular 737 platform. It is a twin-jet narrow-body that could seat between 130 and 230 passengers, based on the variant. Boeing has been taking orders for the aircraft from late 2011. It has received about 4400 orders so far, with an estimated 86 deliveries.Jet Airways Chief Executive Vinay Dube had told reporters last month that the airline hoped to finalise the deal with Boeing by the end of March. Shares of Jet Airways, which rose as much as 3.2 percent in Wednesday morning trade, and closed 1.5 percent lower, in line with the wider trend.Boeing had said last year that it expects Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy.Domestic passenger traffic increased 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier for the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, according to data from the International Air Transport Association.(With inputs from Reuters)', 'Members of Parliament of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance government have decided to not take salary and allowances for 23 days of the Budget session. Union minister Ananth Kumar said that since Parliament hasn’t been functional, the government has no right to take people’s money.“BJP-NDA MPs have decided to not take salary and allowances for 23 days as Parliament has not been functional. This money is given to serve the people and if we are not able to do so we have no right to take the people’s money,” said Ananth Kumar.He further hit out at the Congress party, “It’s because of Congress’s undemocratic politics that Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have not been functional. We’re ready to talk about all the issues but they are not letting the houses function.”Meanwhile, leaders of at least 15 Opposition parties are slated to hold protest in front of Mahatma Gandhi statue in Parliament on Thursday on various issues, including banking scam, SC/ST issue and CBSE Paper leak.This comes as the Budget session of Parliament is headed for a washout. Apart from the passage of the Union Budget, no major Bill has been cleared during the session.Among the important bills pending in Parliament during the session are triple talaq bill, Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 and National Medical Commission Bill, 2017.The government, however, pushed two bills – The Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill and The Specific Relief (Amendment) Bill, for passage amid din with the Lok Sabha passing them with a voice vote without debate.Since March 5, when Parliament had met after a recess, the Lok Sabha has seen disruptions on a daily basis. Amid the din, the Finance Bill and the appropriation bills were yesterday passed by the House without discussion.Recently, Ananth Kumar had hit out at the Congress for Parliament impasse, saying, “It seems (Congress leaders) Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi don’t believe in democracy. They speak outside (the house) on democracy but don’t practice it in Parliament. The Congress(men) doesn’t have democracy in their genes.”He had asked other parties to discuss the pending bills constructively.“We have included all important issues in the list of business. We have also issued a three-line whip to all our MPs. We request all the parties to let the house function and hold constructive discussions,” the Minister had said.', 'Facebook’s acknowledgement that most of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their personal data scraped by “malicious actors” is the latest example of the social network’s failure to protect its users’ data.Not to mention its seeming inability to even identify the problem until the company was already embroiled in scandal. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters Wednesday that Facebook is shutting down a feature that let people search for Facebook users by phone number or email address. Although that was useful for people who wanted to find others on Facebook, it turns out that unscrupulous types also figured out years ago that they could use it to identify individuals and collect data of their profiles.The scrapers were at it long enough, Zuckerberg said, that “at some point during the last several years, someone has probably accessed your public information in this way.”The only way to be safe would have been for users to deliberately turn off that search feature several years ago. Facebook had it turned on by default.“I think Facebook has not been clear enough on how to use its privacy settings,” said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy for Arizona State University’s Global Security Initiative. “That, to me, was the failure.”The breach was a stunning admission for a company already reeling from allegations that the political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately accessed data on as many as 87 million Facebook users to influence elections.Over the past few weeks, the scandal has mushroomed into investigations across continents, including a probe by the US Federal Trade Commission. Zuckerberg himself will be questioned by Congress for the first time on Tuesday.“The FTC looked the other way for years when consumer groups told them Facebook was violating its 2011 deal to better protect its users. But now the Cambridge Analytica scandal has awoken the FTC from its long digital privacy slumber,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director for the Washington-based privacy non-profit Center for Digital Democracy.Neither Zuckerberg nor his company has identified those who carried out the data scraping. Outside experts believe they could have been identity thieves, scam artists or shady data brokers assembling marketing profiles.Zuckerberg said the company detected the problem in a data-privacy audit started after the Cambridge Analytica disclosures but didn’t say why the company hadn’t noticed it — or fixed it — earlier.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on when it discovered the data scraping.In his call with reporters Wednesday, Zuckerberg said the company had tried “rate limiting” the searches. This restricted how many searches someone can conduct at one time from a particular IP address, a numeric designation that identifies a device’s location on the internet. But Zuckerberg said the scrapers circumvented that defence by cycling through multiple IP addresses.The scraped information was limited to what a user had already chosen to make public — which, depending on a person’s privacy settings, could be a lot — as well as what Facebook requires people to share. That includes full name, profile picture and listings of school or workplace networks.But hackers and scam artists could then use that information — and combine it with other data in circulation — to pull hoaxes on people, plant malware on their computers or commit another mischief.Having access to such a massive amount of data could also pose national security risks, Winterton said.A foreign entity could conceivably use such information to influence elections or stir up discord — exactly what Russia is alleged to have done, using Facebook and other social media, in the 2016 presidential elections.Privacy advocates have long been critical of Facebook’s penchant for pushing people to share more and more information, often through pro-sharing default options.While the company offers detailed privacy controls — users can turn off ad targeting, for example, or face recognition, and post updates that no one else sees — many people never change their settings, and often don’t even know how to.The company has tried to simplify its settings multiple times over the years, most recently this week.Winterton said that for individual Facebook users, worrying about this data scraping won’t do much good — after all, the data is already out there.

Neither is true.', 'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre how legitimate would it be to ask 120 crore people of the country to link their mobile phones to Aadhaar just to get hold of a few terrorists. “Do terrorists apply for SIM cards? It is a problem that you are asking the entire 120 crore people to link their mobile phones with Aadhaar just to catch a few terrorists,” a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra said.The bench also added that the government may have “legitimate State interest”, but asked how fair would it be to ask 120 crore people to link their Aadhaar with mobile to catch a few. “Mere legitimate state interest does not ensure proportionality,” it added.The bench is hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the validity of Aadhaar and its enabling 2016 law. During the hearing, the top court also disagreed with the Centre’s submissions and said that Aadhaar cannot stop banking frauds. “There is no doubt about the identity of fraudsters. The bank knows whom it is giving loan and it is the bank officials who are hand-in-glove with the fraudsters. Aadhaar can do little to stop it,” the bench said.The apex court also said that it seems that bank officials are hand in glove with fraudsters and that scams do not happen because the culprits are unknown. “Banking fraud does not happen because of multiple IDs. Aadhaar will not prevent an individual from operating layers of commercial transactions. It would not prevent bank frauds either,” the bench told Attorney General KK Venugopal who is representing the Centre. The AG had submitted that biometrics were safe and could solve problems like “money laundering, bank frauds, income tax evasion and terrorism”. Advocating for Aadhaar, he said that the UIDAI was seeking minimal information to generating Aadhaar and most of it was already available in public domain. He referred to the example of lawyers and said their addresses, phone numbers, photographs are there in public domain. He said the invasion of privacy was very minimal in Aadhaar and it may not even be considered as an invasion.', 'Gold Coast: Sanjita Chanu won India’s third medal at 21st Commonwealth games by winning gold in women’s 53kg weightlifting category on Friday.Sanjita lifted a total of 192kg to finish ahead of Loa Dika Toua (182kg) of Papua New Guinea and Rachel Leblanc-Bazinet of Canada (181kg) .The girl from Manipur also broke Commonwealth Games record by lifting 84kgs in snatch in this category.

The Bollywood superstar was sentenced to five years in jail and fined Rs 10,000.The 52-year-old actor will now spend at least one night in jail before his legal team can move a bail application on his behalf.Salman was visibly emotional after the verdict was announced and was seen hugging his two sisters. Scenes outside the Jodhpur court though showed mixed emotions with fans reiterating their support for him while close to a hundred members of Bishnoi community – who rever blackbucks – celebrated.Salman and the other Bollywood stars had been accused of poaching two blackbucks – an endangered animal – in Bhagoda ki Dhani in Kankani village near Jodhpur on October 2, 1998, during the shooting of the movie ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’. Public Prosecutor Bhawani Singh Bhati had said that all of them were in a Gypsy car that night, with Salman in the driving seat. He also said that when Salman spotted a herd of black bucks, he shot at and killed two of them.Salman’s counsel, however, had said that the prosecution had engaged in tampering and fabricating evidence as well as roping in fake witnesses to prove its case.While Salman was charged under Section 9/51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, the other actors had been charged under Section 51 read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code.The conviction of Salman would not only come as a big blow to the actor and his fans but to Bollywood as well – especially because there are several film projects in the pipeline which involve the superstar. He has been busy shooting for Remo D’Souza’s Race 3, a film which is scheduled to hit theatres on June 15 on the occasion of Eid. Besides Race 3, Salman has Atul Agnihotri’s Bharat to be directed by Ali Abbas Zafar in his kitty.

After the second day, BCCI’s media rights value has already gone up by 56 percent with the per match value touching nearly Rs 60 crore (Rs 59.16 crore) for 102 international games across three formats.This is already Rs 17 crore more compared to Rs 43 crore (per match) during the earlier period (2012-2018).“This is the power of Indian cricket. It can resist any kind of negativity, administrative mess and even bigger controversies. The potential bidders know that in India, only one sport can give you proper return on investment.

It was nowhere close to being my best performance but I am glad that it was enough to get me a silver medal,” a grinning Gururaja said after the effort.Gururaja was third after snatch, pulling off a best of 111kg after two good lifts before surviving a few nervy moments in clean and jerk.The Indian failed in his first two attempts before managing a good lift off his last chance to zoom to the top half of the table.“I didn’t quite understand why my second lift was not declared valid. It was disallowed for a very minor movement of the arm. Had it been allowed I could have gone for a higher lift an perhaps target gold. But still I am happy,” said the diminutive lifter from Karnataka.Ahmed, meanwhile, bettered his compatriot Hamizan Amirul Ibrahim’s snatch record of 116kg, created in 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games. He then broke the overall Games record, which was also in the name of Ibrahim.The Malaysia showman, who got the crowd behind him with his exuberant celebrations after every successful lift. was simply unstoppable, leaving a fairly occupied Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre enthralled.The third position was taken by Sri Lanka’s Lakmal Chaturanga (114+134). “The medals for the last three years have been rotating among the three of us,” Gururaja observed.Gururaja, a low-ranking Indian Air Force employee, is a quintessential Indian sports story of immense hardships and just a tiny bit of luck.Son of a truck driver, Gururaja had aspired to be a wrestler for the longest time before being pushed into weightlifting by a watchful coach who saw potential in him.“I am happy I took up weightlifting,” he laughed.', 'Mumbai: Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has finally opened up about his row with his ‘Fate of the Furious’ co-star Vin Diesel, which was touted to be one of the biggest feuds of 2016.Two years after the issue, Johnson has revealed how their relationship became so strained that they couldn’t even film at the same time.“That is correct. We were not in any scenes together,” Johnson told Rolling Stone, as reported by E! Online.“Vin and I had a few discussions, including an important face-to-face in my trailer,” the 45-year-old told the magazine.“And what I came to realize is that we have a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach movie-making and collaborating. It took me some time, but I’m grateful for that clarity. Whether we work together again or not.”Johnson sparked reports of a feud with Diesel in 2016 after he posted on Instagram that he had a serious issue with the behavior of one of his cast-mates, calling the unidentified man unprofessional and a ‘candyass.’It soon became clear to all that Diesel was the co-worker being criticized.', 'Gold Coast: Saina Nehwal has been in the news since Monday after she vented her anger at the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) for denying accreditations to her father, Harvir Singh Nehwal at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games Village in Australia. Matters got so worse, that the ace Indian shuttler threatened to pull out of the tournament if her father was denied entry.However, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) sorted the issue out on Wednesday and granted access to Mr Nehwal at the Games Village. However, many fans are still upset about Saina’s stance about not playing any matches and the badminton star expressed her views once again on the issue. “I had made the payment and booked tickets for my father. The federation or the IOA confirmed to me that it’s sorted out. When you tell me something, and when I am paying you the whole thing… but this is not about money, it is about respect. Imagine if your parent is there with you and made to look for a place to stay at midnight,” she was quoted saying by The Indian Express.Saina later filed a written complaint to the IOA over their failure about informing her that her father would be denied access and said she was shown lack of respect due to which she decided to pull out.“If you want to say Saina is bad, then I am bad, for my parents. l this wouldn’t have happened if they (IOA) had sorted out the issue. There wouldn’t have been any controversy. My father’s name was cut after we reached here and the chef de mission had signed on the paper. I was patient and pleaded for two days. I lost my cool… how much longer would I wait? I’d made all the arrangements. I paid for his accreditation. Why make him struggle? Make me struggle… This is about respect,” she said.Saina said she did not feel anything wrong with parents accompanying athletes during such tournaments.“I think it’s not an issue at all. We should pay for our parents, which I totally agree. But I feel they have made us what we are. Our parents are the number one officials for us, then the others. I don’t even care who the other official is. They (parents) are the first ones who have been looking after you since childhood. I am nobody without them. They made me, so I am more than happy to fight for them. I have not done anything wrong. I have done what I had to do. I asked for what they (IOA) promised me. I didn’t do anything extra,” she added.Saina stated that she paid the IOA Rs 74,780 on March 31 to bear the cost of her father’s accommodation inside the Village following the Sports Ministry’s refusal to pay for her father’s expense. The IOA promised her that the money would grant Harvir an all-access accreditation and a bed in the Village. However, when they landed in Australia on Monday, he wasn’t allowed any entry.“I reached the Village at around 11 pm on April 2. At the reception, I was told my father was accredited as a personal coach and could not stay with me in the Village. I asked the chef de mission (Vikram Sisodia) the reason but he did not have the answer. He was fumbling.  The list shows clearly that the name (of her father) was cut. If you see all these things, it hurts so much… I didn’t want to fight much because I knew it would get worse. The next day, he came inside the Village and was sitting in the (IOA) office till 7 or 8 in the night. I was stuck, too. I couldn’t train. Should I train or worry about these things? If they had told me before that it’s not happening, I would have done it on my own,” Saina explained.But IOA secretary general Rajeev Mehta said that Saina Nehwal and her father weren’t given any assurance.“The Au$ 1,480 does not guarantee a bed inside the Village, it only allows visiting and food expenses. We had informed all federations about this policy several times. It was their duty to inform the athletes. Plus, the organising committee decides the quota of the number of officials who can stay overnight in the Village. We followed the procedure laid down by the organisers,” he said.Despite her troubles, Saina has got off to a decent start at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. On Thursday, Saina won her opening match easily by beating Dilrukshi Beruwelage 21-8, 21-4 in India’s 5-0 thrashing of Sri Lanka. Later on, she overpowered Pakistan’s Mahoor Shahzad 21-7, 21-11 as the Indian team registered their second 5-0 win in a row.', 'Mumbai: While the cricketing fraternity is still coming to terms with the ball-tampering row involving Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, another controversy is already on its way as it is now reported that an Indian cricket team member from ICC World Cup 2011-winning squad, is under scrutiny over alleged links with the match-fixing syndicates.MS Dhoni-led India had beaten Sri Lanka in the final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to lift the coveted trophy after 28 years.  While, Arjuna Ranatunga – Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup-winning skipper, had demanded an investigation into the India vs Sri Lanka 2011 final, it is learnt that a member of that Indian squad is being probed for his alleged links with the match-fixing syndicate which had organised a T20 tournament – Rajputana Premier League (RPL) – in Jaipur in July 2017.It is reported that the tournament first came under Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Anti-Corruption Security Unit’s scanner last year and it is now being investigated by Rajasthan Police’s CID. The tournament, which was telecasted live on Neo Sports, involved club cricketers.According to a report in The Indian Express, the Indian player, who represented Indian in all three formats of the games, had links with the person, who reportedly runs “organised cricket racket”, and who partially funded the tournament. The report further stated that Rajasthan Police has found that link. The report further says that the Indian cricketer was spotted on the sidelines of the tournament.The police had arrested 14 people – which had organisers, players, umpires and alleged bookies – in July from the hotel and laptops, mobiles, cash and walkie-talkie were recovered from them. While the case was transferred to CID in November 2017, the 14 arrested are out on the bail. Such leagues reportedly make Rs 2-3 crores a week.“We are currently probing links between private entities, those who are part of the cricket fraternity and officials. We will take action if there is evidence that links them to corruption,” Pankaj Kumar Singh, Additional DGP CID (Crime), told The Indian Express while saying that the police is following all leads.While he refused to share details of the possible involvement of an Indian cricketer in the racket, it is reported that the police is banking on call records to unearth what could be a “high profile” case.Meanwhile, the report also says that spotter or a handler is stationed right outside the ground to ensure the “plan”, as decided before hand, is executed. The spotter reportedly tells players what the bookies want via the walkie-talkies that are used by the on-field umpires.RPL had witnessed a bizarre turn of events, one including a bowler bowling huge wides in the final over of the match, with the opponent requiring over ten runs to win the match.  ', 'New York: In a first, a team of scientists developed human heart muscle using stem cells that function just like the adult human heart, an advance which would help make drug development significantly faster, safer and cheaper.Researchers have developed the adult-like human heart muscle in just four weeks time in the lab from blood-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).A team of researchers from the Columbia University, essentially compressed the timeframe for development, which normally takes nine months, into a faster and more complete transition to cardiac maturity.Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, Biomedical Engineering Professor at the varsity,”Human cardiac tissues grown in the lab that displays the behaviour of native heart muscle would be transformative for biomedical research.”“To reach this goal, we forced the cultured heart muscle to go through the foetal-to-postnatal transition by an accelerated development. This was done by using early-stage iPS-CMs and increasing the frequency of electrically induced contractions, little by little, every day. The tissues responded, and displayed adult-like gene expression, remarkably organised ultrastructure, and a number of functional features seen in the mature heart muscle, after only four weeks of culture,” Vunjak-Novakovic explained.In the study, researchers found that the longer they waited to introduce physical stimuli such as electric current and mechanical stimulation to the iPSCs, the less responsive the cells were.The team reasoned that the earlier they introduced electromechanical stimuli, the greater the effect would be.“The resulting engineered tissue is truly unprecedented in its similarity to functioning human tissue,” said Seila Selimovic, Director of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) Tissue Chips program.“The ability to develop mature cardiac tissue in such a short time is an important step in moving us closer to having reliable human tissue models for drug testing,” Selimovic noted.The study was published in the journal Nature.(With IANS inputs)', 'Thiruvannthapuram: The Thiruvananthapuram Rural Police on Thursday arrested a 33-year-old man for aiding men who allegedly murdered radio jockey Rajesh last month. The accused was identified as B. Sanu, 33 of Kunninmelcheri, Shakthikulangara. He was in contact with the accused through a WhatsApp group. He was a close friend of Appunni of Alappuzha who led the four-member gang.Sanu gave a hideout for the accused to plan the attack and provided them accommodation at his house ahead of the attack. He used to secretly monitor the day-to-day activities of victim Rajesh. Two swords were also found from his rented premises at Kuripuzha colony. Rajesh was allegedly engaged in a love affair with a woman residing at Qatar. Her businessman husband had given a contract for the attack. He also sent in his employee to oversee the execution of Rajesh. The radio jockey Rajesh, 36, alias Rasikan Rajesh was hacked to death by a gang on March 27.

He will have a simple wooden bed, a rug and a cooler in his cell, Singh said.“He (Khan) was given normal jail diet like Dal chapatti and the morning meal will include simple khichdi,” he said.Sources, however, said the Bollywood icon did not eat the jail food.Jail superintendent Vikram Singh said the actor had a blood pressure issue when he came inside the jail and the doctor of the prison dispensary checked him. His blood pressure was later declared normal.On the reported threat to Salman Khan by a gangster, Vikram Singh said, “We are thinking of keeping him with some other prisoners from tomorrow so that he is not alone considering the threat to him.”A local gangster had reportedly said he would kill Khan in Jodhpur.', 'New Delhi: Budget carrier IndiGo, which had initially evinced interest in acquiring Air India’s international operations, on Thursday said it was not in fray to bid for the national carrier as such option was not available under the disinvestment plan.“From day one, IndiGo has expressed its interest primarily in the acquisition of Air India’s international operation and Air India Express. However, that option is not available under the government’s current disinvestment plan for Air India.” “Also, as we have communicated before, we do not believe we have the capability to take on the task of acquiring and successfully turning around all of Air India’s airline operations,” president and whole time director of IndiGo Aditya Ghosh said in a statement.IndiGo, a market leader in the Indian skies with close to 40 per cent share, was one of the first players to show interest in the ailing airline soon after the government gave its in-principal approval in June 2017 for the disinvestment of the national carrier. It had written to the civil aviation ministry expressing its interest to buy out Air India’s flight operations, particularly the international services.On March 28, the ministry came out with the preliminary information memorandum on Air India’s strategic disinvestment. According to the memorandum, the government plans to offload 76 per cent equity share capital of the national carrier as well as transfer the management control.The proposed transaction would involve Air India, its low-cost arm Air India Express and Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt Ltd, which is an equal joint venture between the national airline and Singapore-based SATS Ltd.In July 2017, IndiGo’s founder Rakesh Gangwal had raised concern of having a joint ownership with the government in Air India during a conference call with investors and analysts, saying it was a “very very difficult proposition”.While virtually ruling out the possibility of running Air India along with the government, he also cautioned that it would be a “Shakespearean tragedy” if the national carrier’s international assets go to a foreign entity.IndiGo has been expressing concerns over the country’s international air traffic being captured by Gulf carriers.Against this backdrop, Gangwal had said that if a foreign airline was to get hold of Air India’s international assets such as slots and landing rights, then the economic interests of that particular entity would be maximised.', 'Recent months may have seen China and Pakistan closely working in diplomatic circles and on development projects. All though is not well for Chinese workers in Pakistan who – apart from facing a threat to their lives – recently clashed with cops for allegedly being barred from red light areas.Pakistan-based Dawn has reported that several Chinese workers thrashed local cops – deployed for their own safety – for stopping them from venturing into red light districts. The incident occurred around in a project area for the construction of a highway between Bahawalpur and Faisalabad. Local media said cops refused to give permission to Chinese engineers and other workers from leaving their camps minus a security cover. When the workers refused protection, they were barred from leaving. And all hell broke loose.The local administration has alleged several Chinese workers threatened and then attempted to thrash security personnel. Several even reportedly stood on police cars and eventually cut power supply to the area where their own Pakistani guards were being housed. ARY News reported that one of the workers even flung a chair at the security head.The incident took place on Tuesday and while the situation was somehow brought under control, it was not the end of it. A day later, Chinese workers halted work on the construction site, abandoned heavy machinery on surrounding roads and then wrote a letter to government officials alleging that it is they who had been attacked by security personnel.While the incident has been heavily criticised in Pakistan – a country increasingly looking for China’s help in almost every field, there has been no official statement from the Chinese company or from Beijing regarding the incident, yet.', 'Washington: United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday night signed a proclamation to deploy the US national guards at the US-Mexican border to block the movement of illegal immigrants into the country via the Mexican border.“The president has directed that the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security work together with our governors to deploy our National Guard to our southwest border to assist the border patrol,” Fox News reported Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, as saying at the White House press briefing. “Despite a number of steps this administration has taken…we continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity, transnational criminal organisations and illegal immigration flow across our border,” she added.The deployment of the National Guard to the border had reportedly cost 415 million dollars under the George W Bush administration.This comes after the Trump’s statement at the Baltic summit on Tuesday where he claimed to prepare its military forces to guard the (US-Mexico) borders after consulting Former Major General of US Army (Ret.) General David Morris.Further details regarding the number of military troops deployed, their positions, the financing of the troops and the total duration of military deployment at the borders have not been disclosed. The United States is already funding the on-going construction of a wall at US-Mexico border.', 'Riga: Russia began testing missiles with live munitions in the Baltic Sea on Wednesday, alarming Latvia, a member of NATO, which says the drills have forced it partly to shut down Baltic commercial airspace.The Russian defence ministry said on Monday that its Baltic Fleet, based in its European exclave of Kaliningrad, was preparing for routine training in the Baltic Sea, including live fire drills to practice hitting air and sea targets. “It is a demonstration of force,” Latvia’s Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis said. “It is hard to comprehend that it can happen so close to (our) country,” he said.The tests are being carried out in Latvia’s exclusive economic zone, officials said, an area of the sea just beyond Latvia’s territorial waters where Latvia has special economic rights, as well as further west in the Baltic Sea.Riga has closed some of its airspace for the three days of tests, and Sweden also issued a warning to civilian sea traffic and said there could be delays and disruption to civilian air traffic.The missile tests and military drills follow Russia’s massive war games last September, which stretched from the Baltics to the Black Sea. The exercises unnerved the West because of their scale, scope and what NATO said was a lack of transparency.At a time of high East-West tensions, NATO officials worry that any accident involving military weapons and a civilian ship or plane could spark a wider conflict.In Ottawa, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would follow the tests closely while noting that every nation had the right to carry out military exercises.“We are staying vigilant and we are also increasing the readiness of our forces, especially in the Baltic region,” he told reporters after meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Moscow accuses NATO of stirring up anti-Russian propaganda.‘Provocative action’Latvia said Russian drills have never taken place so near its territory. Kucinskis noted that the decision to test so close to Latvian waters came after the West’s expulsion of Russian diplomats last month, the largest since the Cold War.The diplomats were expelled after a nerve agent attack on March 4 against a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Salisbury, England.Latvian officials said Russia is not breaking any international rules and has the right to exercise. But the Latvian defence ministry summoned Russia’s military attache to express its concern. Russia says it is testing its forces after the winter.“Drills lasting for three days in the region where there is very intensive aviation traffic, and given everything else that is happening in relations between the West and Russia, I think that it is a rather provocative action,” Latvia’s ambassador to Russia, Maris Riekstins, told Latvian Television.']\n"
